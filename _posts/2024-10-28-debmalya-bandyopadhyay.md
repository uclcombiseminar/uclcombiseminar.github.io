Let $K_n^{(k)}$ be the complete $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices. A tight cycle is a $k$-uniform graph with its vertices cyclically ordered so that every~$k$ consecutive vertices form an edge, and any two consecutive edges share exactly $k-1$ vertices. A result by Bustamante, Corsten, Frankl, Pokrovskiy and Skokan shows that all $r$-edge coloured $K_{n}^{(k)}$ can be partition into $c_{r,k}$ vertex disjoint monochromatic tight cycles. However, the constant $c_{r,k}$ is of tower-type. In this work, we show that $c_{r,k}$ is a polynomial in $r$.
