<p>Dirichlet’s Theorem from Diophantine approximation says that for any real number $t$, there is some $v\in \{1,2,...,n\}$ such that $tv$ lies within $1/(n+1)$ of an integer.  The Lonely Runner Conjecture of Wills and Cusick asserts that the constant $1/(n+1)$ in this theorem cannot be improved by replacing $\{1,2,...,n\}$ with a different set of $n$ non-zero real numbers. The conjecture, although now more than 50 years old, remains wide open for $n$ larger than $7$.  In this talk I will describe a new approach based on the “Lonely Runner spectra” that arise when one considers the “inverse problem” for the Lonely Runner Conjecture.</p>
<p>Based on joint work with Vikram Giri and with Vanshika Jain.</p>
