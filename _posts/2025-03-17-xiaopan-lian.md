The square of a graph $G$, denoted $G^2$, has the same vertex set as $G$ and has an edge between two vertices if the distance between them in $G$ is at most $2$. In general, $\Delta(G) + 1 \leq \chi(G^2) ≤ \Delta(G)^2+1$ for every graph $G$. Charpentier posed the question of whether $\chi(G^2) ≤ 2\Delta(G)$ if the maximum average degree of $G$ is less than $4$. Cranston and Yu proved that $\omega(G^2) ≤5\Delta(G)/2+72$ if $G$ is a $2$-degenerate graph. We modified their result by showing that if $G$ is a $2$-degenerate graph with $\Delta(G)$ sufficiently large, then $\omega(G^2) \leq5\Delta(G)/2$. Moreover, this bound is tight.
