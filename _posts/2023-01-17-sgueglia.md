subtitle: Spanning subgraphs in randomly perturbed graphs

excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
We study the model of randomly perturbed dense graphs, which is the union of any $n$-vertex graph $G_{\alpha}$ with minimum degree at least $\alpha n$ and the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$.
In this talk, we discuss questions on the containment of various spanning structures, and we offer several new sharp and stability results. We also point out a number of interesting questions that remain open.

This is joint work with Julia B&ouml;ttcher, Olaf Parczyk, and Jozef Skokan.
