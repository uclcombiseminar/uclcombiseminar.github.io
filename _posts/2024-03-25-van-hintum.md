subtitle: Locality in sumsets and Ruzsaâ€™s discrete Brunn-Minkowski inequality
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

We explore higher dimensional additive phenomena   
in the integers proving optimal bounds in Freiman type results. 
As a quick consequence of the technical framework 
we prove a Brunn-Minkowski type inequality conjectured 
by Ruzsa asserting the following. 
For all $\epsilon>0$, there exists $n$ so that given sets 
of integers A and B so that B is not contained efficiently 
in $n$ generalised arithmetic progressions of dimension $(d-1)$, 
then $|A+B|^{1/d}> |A|^{1/d} + (1-\epsilon)|B|^{1/d}$.
