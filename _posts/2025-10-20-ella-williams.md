subtitle: Embedding trees using minimum and maximum degree conditions
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

<p>A variant of the notable Erdős-Sós conjecture, posed by Havet, Reed, Stein and Wood, states that every graph with minimum degree at least $\lfloor 2k/3 \rfloor$ and maximum degree at least $k$ contains a copy of every tree with $k$ edges. Both of these bounds are best possible. For large trees with bounded maximum degree, we prove this exactly, building on approximate results already known in the dense setting due to Besomi, Pavez-Signé and Stein. We also prove similar, approximate results for related conjectures, where alternative degree combinations are considered.</p>
