subtitle: On random regular graphs and the Kim-Vu Sandwich Conjecture

The random regular graph $G_d(n)$ is selected uniformly at random from all $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices. This model is a lot harder to study than the Erdős-Renyi binomial random graph model $G(n, p)$ as the probabilities of edges being present are not independent. However, in the regime $d \gg \log n$, various graph properties including Hamiltonicity and chromatic number were shown (with hard work) to be the same in $G_d(n)$ as in $G(n, p)$ with $np = d$, which inspired Kim and Vu to conjecture that when $d \gg \log n$ it is possible to ‘sandwich’ the random regular graph $G_d(n)$ between two Erdős-Renyi random graphs with similar edge density. A proof of this sandwich conjecture would unify all the previous separate hard-won results. 

Various authors have proved weaker versions of the sandwich conjecture with incrementally improved bounds on d — the previous state of the art was due to Gao, Isaev and McKay who proved the conjecture for $d \gg (\log n)^4$.  I will sketch our new proof of the full conjecture.

This is joint work with Richard Montgomery and Daniel Il’kovič.
