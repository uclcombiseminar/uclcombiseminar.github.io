subtitle: Less Than Half of All Oriented Paths Are Anti-Sidorenko

<p>An oriented graph $H$ is "tournament anti-Sidorenko" if the number of homomorphisms from $H$ to any tournament $T$ is at most $(1/2)^{|A(H)|}|V(T)|^{|V(H)|}$. He, Mani, Nie and Tung conjectured that a random orientation of a long path is tournament anti-Sidorenko with probability at least $1/2 - o(1)$. We disprove their conjecture by proving that the probability of this event is at most $0.445 +o(1)$. Our proof uses a Central Limit Theorem of Janson and the Cramér–Wold Device from probability theory together with ideas from combinatorial limits. Joint work with Hao Chen, Felix Christian Clemen and Anastasiia Sharfenberg.
