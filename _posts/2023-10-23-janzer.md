subtitle: Packing the largest trees in the tree packing conjecture

excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

The tree packing conjecture of Gyárfás from 1976 says that any sequence of trees $T_1,\ldots,T_n$ such that $|T_i|=i$ for each $i$ packs into $K_n$.
Packing even just the largest trees in such a sequence has proven difficult, with Bollobás drawing attention to this in 1995 by conjecturing that, for each $k$, if $n$ is sufficiently large then the largest $k$ trees in any such sequence can be packed. Despite many partial results and much related work on the full tree packing conjecture, even this weakening remained open. We prove Bollobás’s conjecture, by showing that, moreover, a linear number of the largest trees can be packed in the tree packing conjecture. Joint work with Richard Montgomery.
