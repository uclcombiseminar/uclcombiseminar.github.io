<p>We show that if $G$ is a $2n$-vertex, $(n+1)$-regular graph, sampling each vertex of $G$ at independently at random with probability $p=1/2$ induces a subgraph $G_{1/2}$ with a Hamilton cycle, with probability at least $1/2$. This settles a problem of Erdős and Faudree who asked if this probability can be bounded below by an absolute constant. The result indicates a curious phase shift: if $G$ is a $2n$-vertex, $n$-regular graph, the probability that $G_{1/2}$ is Hamiltonian can be as low as $n^{-1/2}$ (consider $G=K_{n,n}$). Many open problems remain, for example, we conjecture that a similar phase shift occurs infinitely often for regular Hamiltonian graphs at much lower densities.</p>
