subtitle: Extremal graphs in the generalized Tur\'an problem

excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
One of the first results in extremal graph theory is Tur\'an's
theorem, which states that the Tur\'an graph $T(n,r)$ 
maximizes the number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that 
does not contain $K_{r+1}$ as a subgraph. More generally, 
given two graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Tur\'an number 
$ex(n, H, F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in an 
$n$-vertex $F$-free graph and such graphs with $ex(n, H, F)$ 
copies of $H$ are called extremal graphs. 
For fixed $H$, $F=K_{r+1}$ and $r$ large enough, 
we recently showed in a joint work with Morrison, Nir, Norine, 
and Rz{\k{a}}{\.z}ewski, that the extremal graph for the 
generalized Tur\'an problem is the Tur\'an graph  $T(n,r)$. 
This talk discusses this result and more broadly, 
results on generalized Tur\'an numbers.
