<p> A perfect $K_r$-tiling in a graph $G$ is a collection of vertex-disjoint copies of the graph $K_r$ in $G$ that covers all vertices of $G$. In this talk, we prove that the threshold for the existence of a perfect $K_{r}$-tiling of a randomly perturbed balanced $r$-partite graph on $rn$ vertices is $n^{-2/r}$. This result is a multipartite analog of a theorem of Balogh, Treglown, and Wagner and extends our previous result, which was limited to the bipartite setting.</p>
