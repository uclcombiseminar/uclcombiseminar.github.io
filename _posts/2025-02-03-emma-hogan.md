For a graph $G$, the $k$-colouring graph $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ has vertices corresponding to proper $k$-colourings of $G$, and edges between colourings that differ at a single vertex of $G$. The chromatic polynomial can then be thought of as a function that enumerates the number of vertices in $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ for each $k$. By instead counting instances of other induced subgraphs in $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$, Asgarli, Krehbiel, Levinson and Russell define the family of generalised chromatic polynomials. In this talk we will discuss some properties of the $k$-colouring graph and of generalised chromatic polynomials. This is based on joint work with Alex Scott, Youri Tamitegama and Jane Tan.Â
