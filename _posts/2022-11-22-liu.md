subtitle: An invitation to nondegenerate hypergraph Tur&aacute;n problem

excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

Let us call a graph/hypergraph $G$ extremal if there exists a finite family $F$ such that $G$ is an $F$-free graph with the maximum number of edges. The classical Erd&#337;s--Stone-Simonovitsz theorem implies that Turan graphs approximate all extremal graphs in edit distance. This talk is an invitation to its analogue in the hypergraph setting: what hypergraphs can approximate all extremal hypergraphs? I'll mention some related results.
