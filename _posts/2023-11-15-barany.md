subtitle: Pairwise intersecting convex sets and cylinders in $\mathbb{R}^3$

We prove that given a finite collection of cylinders in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with the property that any two of them intersect, there is a line intersecting an $\alpha$-fraction of the cylinders where $\alpha=1/14$. This is a special case of an interesting conjecture.

This talk will be in Bedford Way (20) room 639 at 3-4pm.
