<p> Let $Q^n$ be the $n$-dimensional binary hypercube. We consider a random subgraph $Q^n_p$ of the hypercube formed by retaining each edge of $Q^n$ independently with probability $p$. Like the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$, this model undergoes a striking phase-transition when $p$ increases beyond the critical value of $1/n$. However, whilst the structure of $G(n,p)$ in this supercritical regime is well understood, much less is known about the structure of $Q^n_p$.</p>
<p>Confirming a long-standing folklore conjecture, stated in particular by Condon, Espuny Díaz, Girão, Kühn, and Osthus, we show that for any constant $\epsilon >0$ there is a $C:=C(\epsilon)$ such that if $p= C/n$, then with high probability $Q^n_p$ contains a path covering all but an $\epsilon$-fraction of its vertices.</p>
<p>This is joint work with Sahar Diskin, Joshua Erde, Mihyun Kang, Michael Krivelevich and Lyuben Lichev.</p>
