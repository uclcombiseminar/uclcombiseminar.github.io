subtitle: Hamilton cycles in randomly perturbed graphs

Let $G$ be a graph of order $n$ with linear minimum degree, and suppose we `perturbe' $G$ by adding the edges of the binomial random graph on the same vertex set. It is well known that if the random graph has edge probability at least $C/n$ for some constant C, then with high probability the perturbed graph is Hamiltonian. We show that if each edge of the perturbed graph gets a colour independently and uniformly at random from a set of size $n$, then with high probability the perturbed graph has a rainbow Hamilton cycle, i.e. one with each edge having a different colour. This is joint work with Shoham Letzter.
