A well known theorem due to Van der Waerden and dating from 1927 states that in any finite
colouring of the natural numbers there exist arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions. Most
Ramsey-theoretical results (finite colourings) have a canonical version. In this setting, the palette of colours
may be infinite but one still would like to characterize all unavoidable sub-structures. For example, the
canonical Van der Waerden’s Theorem, first proved by Erd&#337;s and Graham, states that in any colouring
of $[N]$ there exist either arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions or arbitrarily long rainbow
arithmetic progressions. In this talk, we shall talk about a canonical version of the polynomial Van der
Waerden’s Theorem, originally proved by Bergelson and Liebman.
