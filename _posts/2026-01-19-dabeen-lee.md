<p>Combinatorial optimization is the problem of choosing an optimal combination of items from a discrete set of elements. One of the most pressing challenges in modern applications is to develop efficient methodologies for nonlinear combinatorial optimization. In this talk, we introduce a novel approach to solving nonlinear problems through the lens of boolean polynomials and binary matroids. Discovering connections to binary matroids, we develop a new framework for linearizing the equivalent boolean polynomial optimization formulation. We provide a simple characterization for the convex hull of binary solutions to the linearization when the underlying binary matroid is a projective geometry, which contains all binary matroids over the same ground set as restrictions. We also show that if the matroid satisfies the sums of circuits property, then the convex hull coincides with the associated cocycle polytope. Moreover, taking the signs of the objective coefficients into account, we extend the sums of circuits property to idealness of binary clutters via signed binary matroids.</p>
