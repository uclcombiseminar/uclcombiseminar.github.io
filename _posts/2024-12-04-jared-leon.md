 Abstract:
The tight $\ell$-cycle minus one edge $C_\ell^{3-}$ is the $3$-graph on $\{1,\dots,\ell\}$ consisting of $\ell-1$ consecutive triples in cyclic order. We show that, for every $\ell\ge 5$ not divisible by $3$, the Turán density of $C_{\ell}^{3-}$ is $1/4$, and also show a stability and a finer structure result. This proves a conjecture of Mubayi, Sudakov and Pikhurko from 2011 and extends the results of Balogh and Luo, who established analogous claims for all sufficiently large $\ell$. In this talk, I will present the idea behind the main proof.
