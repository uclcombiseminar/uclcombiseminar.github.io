subtitle: Hamilton decompositions of regular bipartite tournaments

excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
A <em>regular bipartite tournament</em> is an orientation of a complete
balanced bipartite graph $K_{2n,2n}$ where every vertex has its in- and
outdegree both equal to $n$. In 1981, Jackson conjectured that any
regular bipartite tournament can be decomposed into Hamilton cycles. We
prove this conjecture for sufficiently large $n$. Along the way, we also
prove several further results, including a conjecture of Liebenau and
Pehova on Hamilton decompositions of dense bipartite digraphs.
