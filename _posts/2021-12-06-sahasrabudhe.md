subtitle: The singularity probability of random symmetric matrices

excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
Let $M_n$ be drawn uniformly from all $n$ by $n$ symmetric matrices with coefficients in {$-1,1$}. We consider the following basic problem: what is the probability $M_n$ is singular? In this talk I will discuss some recent joint work with Marcelo Campos, Matthew Jenssen and Marcus Michelen, where we show the singularity probability is exponentially small. At the heart of the proof is a combinatorial &#8220;decoupling&#8221; lemma which I suspect has applications well beyond the scope of our work.
