subtitle: Rainbow subgraphs of star-coloured graphs
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

<p> An edge-colouring of a graph $G$ can fail to be rainbow for two reasons: either it contains a monochromatic cherry (a pair of incident edges), or a monochromatic matching of size two. A colouring is a proper colouring if it forbids the first structure, and a star-colouring if it forbids the second structure. I will talk about the problem of determining the maximum number of colours in a star-colouring of a large complete graph which does not contain a rainbow copy of a given graph $H$. This problem is a special case of one studied by Axenovich and Iverson on generalised Ramsey numbers.</p>
