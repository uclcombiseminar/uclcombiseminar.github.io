<p>In 1980, Akiyama, Exoo, and Harary conjectured that the edges of every graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ can be decomposed into at most $\lceil(\Delta+1)/2\rceil$ linear forests, where a linear forest is a collection of vertex-disjoint paths. This conjecture was confirmed asymptotically by Alon in 1988 who showed that $(1+o(1)) \cdot \Delta/2$ linear forests suffice. The current best bound is due to Lang and Postle who showed that there is a decomposition into at most $\Delta/2 + \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\Delta} \log^4\Delta)$ linear forests.</p>

<p>We show that any graph on $n$ vertices can be decomposed into at most $\Delta/2 + \mathcal{O}(\log n)$ linear forests. This improves the previous upper bounds for $\Delta = \Omega(\log^2 n)$. Along the way, we show that any $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices has a spanning linear forest with at most $2 \cdot n / (d+1)$ paths. This resolves a conjecture of Feige and Fuchs and confirms a well-known conjecture of Magnant and Martin up to a factor of 2.</p>

<p>This talk is based on joint work with Micha Christoph, Nemanja Draganić, António Girão, Eoin Hurley, and Alp Müyesser.</p>
