subtitle: Product free sets in groups

excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
A subset $A$ of a group is said to be product free if for all elements $a,b$ in $A$ their product $ab$ is not in $A$. In 1985 Babai and S&oacute;s posed the problem of determining the largest product free sets in the alternating group. We solve this problem completely when $n$ is sufficiently large.

Our proof combines representation theory with a recent machinery we developed called `hypercontractvity for global functionsâ€™.
