subtitle: Hamilton decompositions of regular tripartite tournaments

excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
A regular $k$-partite tournament is a regular orientation 
of the balanced complete $k$-partite graph. KÃ¼hn and Osthus proved 
that for all $k \ge 4$ any large enough regular $k$-partite tournament 
can be decomposed into edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles and conjectured 
the same to be true for all $k$. 
Granet proved the conjecture for $k=2$ and, somewhat surprisingly, 
gave a construction of a non-Hamilton decomposable regular tripartite tournament. 
Our main result is a proof that an approximate version of the conjecture still holds
for $k=3$, i.e. that in each such large tournament one may find edge-disjoint 
Hamilton cycles covering all but $o(n^2)$ edges. We also prove that if $a > 1/3$,
any balanced regular tripartite digraph with minimum semidegree at least $a*n$ is Hamilton decomposable. 

This is based on joint work with J. Lada, V. Patel, Y. Pehova, J. Skokan.
