subtitle: Discrepancy problems for spanning trees in colourings of $K_n$
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
Erdos, Füredi, Loebl and Sós proved in 1995 that for a tree $T$ on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $\Delta$, any red-blue colouring of $K_n$ contains a copy of $T$ where one colour appears on $c(n−1−\Delta)$ more edges than the other.

We answer a question of Erdos, Füredi, Loebl and Sós, generalising their result to $r$ colours. We prove that for a fixed tree $T$ and an $r$-colouring of K_n, for any colour $i$ there is a copy of $T$ where the colour $i$ is over-represented compared to its density in the colouring. We also discuss further related questions and prove other generalisations to $r$ colours.

This is a joint work with Lawrence Hollom, Lyuben Lichev and Julien Portier.
