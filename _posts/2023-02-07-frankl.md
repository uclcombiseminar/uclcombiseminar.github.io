subtitle: Helly numbers of exponential lattices

excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
The Helly number of a set in the plane is the smallest $N$ such that the following is true. If any $N$ members of a finite family of convex sets contains a point of $S$, then there is a point of $S$ which is contained in all members of the family. An exponential lattice with base $x$ consists of points whose coordinates are positive integer powers of $x$. We prove lower and upper bounds on Helly numbers of exponential lattices in terms of $x$, and we determine their values exactly in some cases. We also consider asymmetric exponential lattices, and characterise those that have finite Helly numbers. Joint work with Gergely Ambrus, Martin Balko, Attila Jung and M&aacute;rton Nasz&oacute;di.
