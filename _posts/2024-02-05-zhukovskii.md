subtitle: Stability of large cuts in random graphs

excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
We prove that the family of largest cuts in the binomial random graph 
exhibits the following stability property: with high probability, 
there is a set of $(1-o(1))n$ vertices that is partitioned in the 
same manner by all maximum cuts. We also show some applications of this property - in particular, to the validity of Simonovits's property in binomial random graphs. 
Recall that a graph is $H$-Simonovits, if each of its largest $H$-free subgraphs is $(\chi(H)âˆ’1)$-partite.

The talk is based on joint work with Ilay Hoshen and Wojciech Samotij
