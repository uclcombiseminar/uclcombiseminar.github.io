subtitle: Formalising Ramsey Theory

In March 2023, Campos et al proved 
the first exponential improvement to the upper bound on Ramsey's theorem in the two-colour case, showing R(k) <= (4 - c)^k for a positive constant c. I will discuss the complete formalisation of this result in the Lean theorem prover, and touch on the verification of related Ramsey theory problems. Knowledge of neither the Campos et al paper nor Lean is required.
