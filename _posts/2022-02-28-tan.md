Given any graph with lights turned on at each vertex and buttons corresponding to each vertex that toggle the status (on/off) of the vertex together with its neighbourhood, is there always a sequence of button-pushes that turns all of the lights off? This puzzle is answered by a folklore result of Gallai on partitioning the vertex set of a graph into two parts, each inducing a subgraph with specified degree parity conditions. A natural follow-up is to consider partitions satisfying prescribed degree congruence conditions modulo $q$. Recently, Ferber, Hardiman and Krivelevich showed that, for any $0\leq x \<q$, almost every $G_{n,1/2}$ has a vertex partition into $q+1$ parts such that each induced subgraph has degrees $x \bmod q$, and asked whether the same holds with $q$ parts. In this talk, we outline why this is not the case; in fact, the distribution of the counts of such `goodâ€™ partitions into $q$ parts is asymptotically Poisson. This is joint work with Paul Balister, Emil Powierski and Alex Scott.
