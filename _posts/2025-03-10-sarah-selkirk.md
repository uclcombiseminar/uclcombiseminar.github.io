subtitle: The distribution of the maximum protection number in random trees
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
The protection number of a vertex $v$ is the length of the shortest path from $v$ to any leaf contained in the maximal subtree where $v$ is the root. In this joint work with Clemens Heuberger and Stephan Wagner, we study the maximum protection number in simply generated trees using techniques from analytic combinatorics. We develop new methods with which to study generating functions dependent on multiple parameters, and obtain the distribution for the maximum protection number by applying them.
