subtitle: Packing paths in sparse graphs

This talk is based on joint work with Iršič and Portier about the maximal number of vertices that can be covered by disjoint long paths in $G(n,p)$ in the supercritical regime $p=(1+\epsilon)/n$. As a key ingredient we determine the number of disjoint paths of a given length that can be packed into a random labelled tree. We will also discuss a related algorithmic problem about revealing paths in hidden random graph by querying as few edges as possible.
