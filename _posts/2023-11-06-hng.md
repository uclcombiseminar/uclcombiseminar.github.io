subtitle: Characterising flip process rules with the same trajectories

excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
Garbe, Hladký, Šileikis and Skerman recently introduced a
class of discrete-time random graph processes called flip processes. A
flip process starts with a given $n$-vertex graph, and each step of a flip
process involves randomly selecting a $k$-tuple of distinct vertices and
modifying the induced subgraph according to a predetermined rule. It was
proved by Garbe, Hladký, Šileikis and Skerman that the typical behaviour
of flip processes correspond to certain continuous-time deterministic
graphon trajectories. In this talk I will discuss recent work towards
characterising flip process rules with the same trajectories.

This talk will be in Bedford Way (20) room 639.
