subtitle: A Ramsey Characterisation of Eventually Periodic Words

---
A factorisation $x = u_1u_2\ldots$ of an infinite word $x$ on alphabet $X$ is called ‘super-monochromatic’, for a given colouring of the finite
words $X^∗$ on alphabet $X$, if each word $u_{k_1} u_{k_2} \ldots u_{k_n}$, where $k_1 < · · · < k_n$,
is the same colour. A direct application of Hindman’s theorem shows that
if $x$ is eventually periodic, then for every finite colouring of $X^∗$, there exist a suffix of $x$ that admits a super-monochromatic factorisation. What
about the converse?
In this talk we show that the converse does indeed hold: thus a word $x$ is eventually periodic if and only if for every finite colouring of $X^∗$
there is a suffix of $x$ having a super-monochromatic factorisation. This
has been a conjecture in the community for some time. Our main tool
is a Ramsey result about alternating sums. This provides a strong link
between Ramsey theory and the combinatorics of infinite words.

Joint work with Imre Leader and Luca Q. Zamboni
