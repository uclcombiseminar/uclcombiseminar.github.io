Let $V$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}$, and let $\epsilon > 0$ be a small enough fixed constant. Suppose the distances between each pair of points are revealed according to an Erd\H{o}s-Rényi random graph $G(n,(1+\epsilon)/n)$, meaning that the distance between any two points is revealed independently with probability $p=\frac{1+\epsilon}{n}$. We show that, with high probability, this information is sufficient to reconstruct, up to isometry, a subset of $V$ of size $\Omega_{\epsilon}(n)$. This confirms a conjecture of Girao, Illingworth, Michel, Powierski, and Scott. Our approach involves proving certain structural properties of the $2$-core of $G(n,(1+\epsilon)/n)$, which can be of independent interest. 
In the deterministic setting, Benjamini and Tzalik conjectured that, if the pairwise distances of $V$ are revealed according to the edges of an arbitrary graph $G=(V,E)$, then one can always reconstruct a subset of $\Omega(\frac{|E|}{|V|})$ points. We disprove this conjecture, but show, using a density increment type argument, that one can always reconstruct a subset of size $\frac{|E|e^{-\alpha \sqrt{\log |V|}}}{|V|}$, for some absolute constant $\alpha >0$.

This is joint work with Julian Sahasrabudhe.
