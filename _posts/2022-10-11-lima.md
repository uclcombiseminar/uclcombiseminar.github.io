The focal point of this talk is the recently found connection between two completely different corners of mathematics: multiple orthogonal polynomials, an extension of standard orthogonal polynomials developed and studied by the special-functions community, and branched continued fractions, a generalisation of continued fractions arising from the combinatorics of lattice paths and introduced by the enumerative-combinatorics community to solve total-positivity problems. 

Firstly, we revisit the classical connection between lattice paths, continued fractions, and orthogonal polynomials. Then, we discuss our ongoing research on an extension of this connection linking lattice paths, branched continued fractions, and multiple orthogonal polynomials. This work is part of a collaboration with Alan Sokal.
