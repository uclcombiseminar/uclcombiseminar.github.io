How fast can you reconstruct a network using a ping-pong protocol?
Distance query reconstruction is a setting where we assume an unknown
simple and connected graph, and we try to recover the graph only using
queries of distance between pairs of vertices. In this talk we extend a
result by Kannan, Mathieu, and Zhou in the probabilistic settings,
creating a deterministic algorithm for chordal graphs or a
randomized algorithm able to reconstruct graphs of bounded
treelength with a quasi-linear number of queries in expectation. In
particular, graphs of bounded treelength contain various graph classes of
interest such as k-chordal graphs, permutation graphs and AT-free
graphs. This talk is based on a joint work with Carla Groenland.
