subtitle: Enumerating independent sets in Abelian Cayley graphs

excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

We show that any Cayley graph on an Abelian group of order 2n and degree $\tilde{\Omega}(\log n)$ has at most $2^{n+1}(1+o(1))$ independent sets. This bound is tight up to the $o(1)$ term whenever the graph is bipartite. Proof techniques include the graph container method of Sapozhenko and the Pl&uuml;nnecke-Rusza-Petridis inequality from additive combinatorics.

This is joint work with Aditya Potukuchi.
