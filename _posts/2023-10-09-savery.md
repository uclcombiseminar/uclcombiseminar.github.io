subtitle: Chromatic number is not tournament-local

Scott and Seymour conjectured the existence of a function $f$ such that, for every graph $G$ and tournament $T$ on the same vertex set, $\chi(G)\geq f(k)$ implies that $\chi(G[N_T^+(v)])\geq k$ for some vertex $v$. We will disprove this conjecture even if $v$ is replaced by a vertex set of size $\mathcal{O}(\log{|V(G)|})$. 
As a consequence, we obtain a negative answer to a question of Harutyunyan, Le, Thomassé, and Wu concerning the analogous statement where the graph $G$ is replaced by another tournament. Time permitting, we will also discuss the setting in which chromatic number is replaced by degeneracy, where a quite different behaviour is exhibited.

This is joint work with António Girão, Kevin Hendrey, Freddie Illingworth, Florian Lehner, Lukas Michel, and Raphael Steiner.

This talk will be in Bedford Way (20) room 639.
