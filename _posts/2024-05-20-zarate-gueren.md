subtitle: Colour-bias perfect matchings in hypergraphs
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---
Given a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ and an $r$-colouring of its edges, 
we look for a minimum $l$-degree condition that guarantees the existence 
of a perfect matching in $H$ that has significantly more than $n/rk$ edges in one colour. 
We refer to it as a colour-bias perfect matching.
For $2$-coloured graphs, a result of Balogh, Csaba, Jing and Pluhár yields the 
minimum degree threshold that ensures a perfect matching of significant colour-bias. 
In this talk, I will present an analogous of this result for $k$-uniform hypergraphs. 
More precisely, for each $2 \le l < k$ and $r \ge 2$ we determined the minimum $l$-degree 
threshold for forcing a perfect matching of significant colour-bias in an $r$-coloured $k$-uniform hypergraph.

This is joint work with József Balogh and Andrew Treglown.
