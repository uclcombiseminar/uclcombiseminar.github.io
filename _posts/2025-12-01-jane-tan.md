subtitle: Beyond Negami's Planar Cover Conjecture
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

<p>Negami's famous planar cover conjecture is equivalent to the statement that a connected graph can be embedded in the projective plane if and only if it has a projective planar cover. In 1999, Hliněnỳ proposed extending this conjecture to higher genus non-orientable surfaces. In this talk, we'll put forward a natural extension that encompasses orientable surfaces as well, and discuss some evidence toward it. </p>
