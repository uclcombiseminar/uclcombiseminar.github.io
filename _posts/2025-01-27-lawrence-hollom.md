An old conjecture of Erdős asks, given n unit vectors in dimension d, for a lower bound on the probability that a random signed sum of these unit vectors (taken uniformly at random from the $2^n$ possibilities) lies close to the origin. This conjecture has been corrected, solved, rediscovered and generalised over the years, and so it might appear that there is little more to say about it. However, in this talk we discuss adding a parity condition to $n$, a condition which both adds significant depth to the setting and gives new life to Erdős's original conjecture, giving rise to a wealth of interesting results and wide-open problems. We will also say a few words about optimal constructions in the original setting of Erdős, about which much also remains mysterious.
