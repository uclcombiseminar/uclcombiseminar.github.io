      <h2>Colour-bias perfect matchings in hypergraphs</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Given a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ and an $r$-colouring of its edges, 
we look for a minimum $l$-degree condition that guarantees the existence 
of a perfect matching in $H$ that has significantly more than $n/rk$ edges in one colour. 
We refer to it as a colour-bias perfect matching.
For $2$-coloured graphs, a result of Balogh, Csaba, Jing and Pluhár yields the 
minimum degree threshold that ensures a perfect matching of significant colour-bias. 
In this talk, I will present an analogous of this result for $k$-uniform hypergraphs. 
More precisely, for each $2 \le l &lt; k$ and $r \ge 2$ we determined the minimum $l$-degree 
threshold for forcing a perfect matching of significant colour-bias in an $r$-coloured $k$-uniform hypergraph.</p>

      <h2>On the $(k+2,k)$-problem of Brown, Erdős and Sós for $k=5,6,7$</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Brown-Erdős-Sós initiated the study of the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $r$-graph 
such that no $k$ edges span at most $s$ vertices. 
If $s=rk−2k+2$ then this function is quadratic in $n$ and its asymptotic was previously known for 
$k=2,3,4$. We determine the values of the limit in the Brown-Erdős-Sós problem for $k=5,6,7$ and generalise them to all uniformity.</p>

      <h2>Minimal families of shattering permutations</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Let $n, t, k$ be positive integers and say that a family $\mathcal{P}$ of permutations is $(k,t)$-shattering for $[n]=\set{1,\dotsc, n}$ if it induces at least $t$ distinct orders on each $k$-subset of $[n]$.
In 1971, Spencer constructed $(k,k)$-shattering families of size $O(\log \log n)$ and showed that $(k,k!)$-shattering families have size $\Omega(\log n)$.</p>

<p>Füredi then asked in 1996 whether minimal $(k,t)$-shattering families always have sizes in one of three regimes: $O(1)$, $\Theta(\log \log n)$, $\Theta(\log n)$.
In 2023, Johnson and Wickes settled the case $k=3$ affirmatively and asked whether this could be extended to general $k$.
In recent joint work with António Girão and Lukas Michel show the existence of a jump between the $\Theta(\log \log n)$ regime and a new $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$ regime when $k\geq 4$, thereby answering both the general question of Füredi and the question of Johnson and Wickes negatively.
Moreover, we settle the case $k=4$ and greatly narrow the range of $t$ for which asymptotic sizes of such families are unknown.</p>

      <h2>Improved bounds for Chowla's conjecture with logarithmic weights</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>The Liouville function $\lambda(n)$ is defined to be +1 if n is a product of an even number of primes, and -1 otherwise. In many ways, the Liouville function is expected to behave like a random sequence of +1’s and -1’s. Instances of this phenomenon are intimately connected with the distribution of primes. For instance, the statement that the partial sums of the Liouville function grow no faster than $x^{1/2+\epsilon}$ is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis. The two-point Chowla conjecture predicts that the average of $\lambda(n)\lambda(n+1)$ over $n\leq x$ tends to zero as $x\to \infty$. I will present my work on a logarithmically weighted version of this problem. The proof uses elementary combinatorics to study a graph encoding number-theoretic information.</p>

      <h2>Approximate path decompositions of regular graphs</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>We show that any $d$-regular graph can be approximately decomposed into paths of length almost $d$, giving an approximate solution to a problem of Kotzig from 1957. Along the way, we also show that almost all vertices of a $d$-regular graph can be partitioned into $n/(d+1)$ paths, asymptotically confirming a conjecture of Magnant and Martin from 2009.</p>

      <h2>Extremal graphs in the generalized Turán problem</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>One of the first results in extremal graph theory is Turán’s
theorem, which states that the Turán graph $T(n,r)$ 
maximizes the number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that 
does not contain $K_{r+1}$ as a subgraph. More generally, 
given two graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Turán number 
$ex(n, H, F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in an 
$n$-vertex $F$-free graph and such graphs with $ex(n, H, F)$ 
copies of $H$ are called extremal graphs. 
For fixed $H$, $F=K_{r+1}$ and $r$ large enough, 
we recently showed in a joint work with Morrison, Nir, Norine, 
and Rzążewski, that the extremal graph for the 
generalized Turán problem is the Turán graph  $T(n,r)$. 
This talk discusses this result and more broadly, 
results on generalized Turán numbers.</p>

      <h2>Hamiltonicity of expanders - optimal bounds and applications</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>An $n$-vertex graph $G$ is a $C$-expander if 
$|N(X)|\geq C|X|$ for every $X \subseteq V(G)$ 
with $|X|&lt; n/2C$ and there is an edge between 
every two disjoint sets of at least $n/2C$ vertices.
We show that there is some constant $C&gt;0$ 
for which every $C$-expander is Hamiltonian. 
In particular, this implies the well known 
conjecture of Krivelevich and Sudakov from 2003 
on Hamilton cycles in $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs. 
This completes a long line of research on the 
Hamiltonicity of sparse graphs, and has many applications.</p>

      <h2>Hamilton decompositions of regular tripartite tournaments</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>A regular $k$-partite tournament is a regular orientation 
of the balanced complete $k$-partite graph. Kühn and Osthus proved 
that for all $k \ge 4$ any large enough regular $k$-partite tournament 
can be decomposed into edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles and conjectured 
the same to be true for all $k$. 
Granet proved the conjecture for $k=2$ and, somewhat surprisingly, 
gave a construction of a non-Hamilton decomposable regular tripartite tournament. 
Our main result is a proof that an approximate version of the conjecture still holds
for $k=3$, i.e. that in each such large tournament one may find edge-disjoint 
Hamilton cycles covering all but $o(n^2)$ edges. We also prove that if $a &gt; 1/3$,
any balanced regular tripartite digraph with minimum semidegree at least $a*n$ is Hamilton decomposable.</p>

<p>This is based on joint work with J. Lada, V. Patel, Y. Pehova, J. Skokan.</p>

      <p><p>The question under which minimum degree conditions a given

over the past twenty years. In this talk, I will give an overview of the 
progress in the area and then present some new results.</p>

      <h2>Stability of large cuts in random graphs</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>We prove that the family of largest cuts in the binomial random graph 
exhibits the following stability property: with high probability, 
there is a set of $(1-o(1))n$ vertices that is partitioned in the 
same manner by all maximum cuts. We also show some applications of this property - in particular, to the validity of Simonovits’s property in binomial random graphs. 
Recall that a graph is $H$-Simonovits, if each of its largest $H$-free subgraphs is $(\chi(H)−1)$-partite.</p>

      <h2>Formalising Ramsey Theory</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>In March 2023, Campos et al proved 
the first exponential improvement to the upper bound on Ramsey’s theorem in the two-colour case, showing R(k) &lt;= (4 - c)^k for a positive constant c. I will discuss the complete formalisation of this result in the Lean theorem prover, and touch on the verification of related Ramsey theory problems. Knowledge of neither the Campos et al paper nor Lean is required.</p>

      <h2>Bandwidth theorem for graph transversals</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>The bandwidth of a graph is the minimum $b$ such that 
there is a labeling of the vertex set of $H$ by 
the numbers $1,2,\ldots,n$ with $|i-j|\le b$ 
for every edge $ij$ of $H$. The celebrated bandwidth theorem
states that if $H$ is an $n$-vertex graph with chromatic number $r$,
bounded maximum degree, and bandwidth $o(n)$, then every $n$-vertex 
graph with minimum degree at least $\left(1-\frac{1}{r}+o(1)\right)n$ 
contains a copy of $H$. This minimum degree is best possible up to the $o(1)$ term.</p>

<p>Recently, there have been systematic studies extending spanning subgraph problems
to the setting of transversals over a collection of graphs. 
Given a graph-collection $\mathcal{G}={G_1,\dots, G_h}$ with the same vertex set $V$,
an $h$-edge graph $H$ on the vertex set $V$ is a $\mathcal{G}$-transversal 
if there exists a bijection $\lambda : E(H) \rightarrow {1,\ldots,h}$ such that 
$e\in E(G_{\lambda(e)})$ for each $e\in E(H)$. 
The minimum degree condition $\delta(\mathcal{G})=\min{ \delta(G_i)}$ 
for finding a spanning $\mathcal{G}$-transversal $H$ have been actively 
studied when $H$ is a Hamilton cycle, an $F$-factor, 
a tree with maximum degree $o(n/\log n)$, and power of Hamilton cycles, etc.</p>

<p>Generalizing both these results and the original bandwidth theorem, 
we obtain asymptotically sharp minimum degree conditions for graphs 
with bounded degree and sublinear bandwidth, proving the bandwidth theorem
for graph transversals. This talk is based on joint work 
with Seonghyuk Im, Jaehoon Kim, and Hong Liu.</p>

      <h2>Some extremal results on multipartite hypergraphs.</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>A $k$-uniform hypergraph $H = (V, E)$ is $k$-partite if $V$ can be partitioned into $k$ sets $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ such that each edge in $E$ contains precisely one vertex from each $V_i$. For example, a 2-partite 2-uniform hypergraph is a bipartite graph. In this talk, we will discuss extensions of results on bipartite graphs to this more general setting pf hypergraphs. Specifically, we will consider list colorings, balanced colorings, and balanced independent sets.</p>

      <h2>Shotgun reconstruction of random graphs.</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>We say that a graph $G$ is reconstructible from its $r$-neighbourhoods if all graphs $H$ having the same collection of $r$-balls as $G$ up to isomorphism, are isomorphic to $G$. We are interested in the reconstruction of the Erdős–Renyi random graph $G(n,p)$ for a wide range of values of $r$, aiming to determine the values of $p$ for which $G(n, p)$ is $r$-reconstructible with high probability.
Mossel and Ross showed that the the graph $G(n,p)$ can be reconstructed from its 3-neighbourhoods with high probability provided that $p \gg \log^2(n)/n$. Later, Gaudio and Mossel studied reconstruction from the 1- and 2-neighbourhoods, giving bounds on the values of $p$ for which $G(n,p)$ is reconsructible. For 1-neighbourhoods, this was improved very recently by Huang and Tikhomirov who determined the correct threshold up to logarithmic factors, around $n^{−1/2}$.
In this talk we will show new bounds on p for the $r$-reconstructibility problem in $G(n, p)$. We improve the bounds for 2-neighbourhoods given by Gaudio and Mossel by polynomial factors. We also improve the result of Huang and Tikhomirov for 1-neighbourhoods, showing that the logarithmic factor is necessary. Finally, we determine the exact thresholds for $r$-reconstructibility for $r \ge 3$.
If time permits, I will also discuss new related results on reconstruction of random directed graphs and random matrices.</p>

<p>This based on joint works with Tom Johnston, Alexander Roberts, Alex Scott, Paul Balister, and Youri Tamitegama.</p>

      <h2>Rigid partitions</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>A graph is called $d$-rigid if there exists an embedding of its vertex set into $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that every continuous motion of the vertices that preserves the lengths of all edges actually preserves the distances between all pairs of vertices. In this talk, I will present new sufficient conditions for the $d$-rigidity of a graph in terms of the existence of “rigid partitions” - partitions of the graph that satisfy certain connectivity properties. Following this, I will outline several broadly applicable conditions for the existence of rigid partitions and discuss a few applications, among which are new results on the rigidity of highly-connected, (pseudo)random graphs, and dense graphs. In particular, I will show that $Cd^2\log^2(n)$-connected $n$-vertex graphs are $d$-rigid, a result that can be viewed as a step towards the Lovász-Yemini conjecture, which states that $Cd^2$-connected graphs are $d$-rigid.</p>

<p>The talk is based on joint work with Michael Krivelevich and Alan Lew.</p>

      <h2>Composite Ramsey theorems via trees</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>We discuss a technique for obtaining new Ramsey theorems from the compositions of old ones. As our simplest application, we show that any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ contains arbitrarily large $A,B\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $(A+B)\cup (A\cdot B)$ monochromatic, addressing a problem of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson. More generally, we also prove iterated versions of this, finding monochromatic sets such as ${A \circ_1 (B \circ_2 C): \circ_i\in {+,\cdot}} $ and a variety of mixed arithmetic and geometric versions of van der Waerden’s theorem, finding monochromatic sets such as ${a+id, c\cdot ad^i: i\leq k}$ and ${a(b+ic)^j: i,j\leq k}.$</p>

      <h2>Universality for transversal Hamilton cycles</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>In a recent paper from 2020 Joos and Kim showed that every collection of n graphs $G_1,…,G_n$ on a common vertex set $[n]$ with minimum degree at least $n/2$ contains a Hamilton cycle using exactly one edge from each graph. Such a Hamilton cycle is called transversal, or rainbow. This result directly extends Dirac’s theorem, which can be deduced by taking all graphs in the collection to be isomorphic, and kick-started a systematic study of transversal problems in extremal combinatorics. We show that (asymptotically) the same degree condition guarantees not only a single rainbow Hamilton cycle, but in fact every rainbow Hamilton cycle. That is, if all $G_i$ have minimum degree $(1/2+\varepsilon)n$ for some small $\varepsilon$, then there is a Hamilton cycle $C=e_1…e_n$ whose edges $e_i$ are taken in the natural cyclic ordering, such that each $e_i$ is in $E(G_i)$.</p>

      <h2>Characterising flip process rules with the same trajectories</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Garbe, Hladký, Šileikis and Skerman recently introduced a
class of discrete-time random graph processes called flip processes. A
flip process starts with a given $n$-vertex graph, and each step of a flip
process involves randomly selecting a $k$-tuple of distinct vertices and
modifying the induced subgraph according to a predetermined rule. It was
proved by Garbe, Hladký, Šileikis and Skerman that the typical behaviour
of flip processes correspond to certain continuous-time deterministic
graphon trajectories. In this talk I will discuss recent work towards
characterising flip process rules with the same trajectories.</p>

      <h2>Anti-concentration of Rademacher sums and Tomaszewski's counterpart problem</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>A Rademacher sum is a finite weighted sum of independent Rademacher random variables, that is $R=a_1\epsilon_1+\dots+a_n\epsilon_n$ 
where the $a_i$ are real constants and $\epsilon_i$ are picked independently and uniformly at random from ${-1,+1}$. 
Tomaszewski’s conjecture from 1986 states that every Rademacher sum $R$ of variance 1 satisfies $\mathbb{P}(|R| \leq 1) \geq 1/2$. This problem has attracted significant attention over the years before it was finally settled by Keller and Klein in 2020. 
Tomaszewski’s counterpart problem is concerned with determining $\inf \mathbb{P}(|R| \geq 1)$, where the infimum is taken over the class of Rademacher sums $R$ of variance 1. This problem has also received much attention over the years, with Hitczenko and Kwapień conjecturing in 1994 that the infimum is $7/32$. In this talk we confirm Hitczenko and Kwapień’s conjecture. In fact, our methods enable us to fully determine $f(y)= \inf \mathbb{P}(|R| \geq y\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(R)})$ where the infimum is taken over all Rademacher sums $R$, confirming a conjecture by Lowther and giving a partial answer to a question by Keller and Klein.</p>

      <p><p>The tree packing conjecture of Gyárfás from 1976 says that any sequence of trees $T_1,\ldots,T_n$ such that $|T_i|=i$ for each $i$ packs into $K_n$.
Packing even just the largest trees in such a sequence has proven difficult, with Bollobás drawing attention to this in 1995 by conjecturing that, for each $k$, if $n$ is sufficiently large then the largest $k$ trees in any such sequence can be packed. Despite many partial results and much related work on the full tree packing conjecture, even this weakening remained open. We prove Bollobás’s conjecture, by showing that, moreover, a linear number of the largest trees can be packed in the tree packing conjecture. Joint work with Richard Montgomery.</p>

<p>An infinite graph is quasi-transitive if its vertex set has finitely many orbits under the action of its automorphism group. We obtain a structure theorem for locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor, which is reminiscent of the Robertson-Seymour Graph Minor Structure Theorem. As applications of this result, we prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph attains its Hadwiger number, that is, if such a graph contains arbitrarily large clique minors, then it contains an infinite clique minor. This answers a question of Thomassen from 1992. We also derive some results on the accessibility of quasi-transitive graphs and groups avoiding a minor. Finally, we prove the minor-excluded case of a conjecture of Ballier and Stein (2018) on the domino problem.</p>

We will disprove this conjecture even if $v$ is replaced by a vertex set of size $\mathcal{O}(\log{|V(G)|})$. 
As a consequence, we obtain a negative answer to a question of Harutyunyan, Le, Thomassé, and Wu concerning the analogous statement where the graph $G$ is replaced by another tournament. Time permitting, we will also discuss the setting in which chromatic number is replaced by degeneracy, where a quite different behaviour is exhibited.</p>

      <h2>$K_r$-saturated graphs with large minimum degree</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Given a graph $H$, we say that a graph $G$ is $H$-saturated if $G$ is maximally $H$-free, meaning $G$ contains no copy of $H$ but adding any new edge to $G$ creates a copy of $H$. The saturation problem is to determine the saturation number $\mathrm{sat}(n,H)$, the minimum number of edges in an $H$-saturated graph $G$ on $n$ vertices.  The saturation number of cliques was determined exactly by Erdős, Hajnal and Moon in the 60s. The problem becomes more interesting, however, if we additionally require the minimum degree of $G$ to be large.</p>

<p>Let $\mathrm{sat}(n,K_r,t)$ be the minimum number of edges in a $K_r$-saturated graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\delta(G) \geq t$. Day showed in 2017 that for fixed $r$ and $t$, $\mathrm{sat}(n,K_r,t)=tn-c(r,t)$ for large enough $n$, where $c(r,t)$ is a constant depending on $r$ and $t$. He raised the problem of estimating $c(r,t)$ and proved the estimates</p>

\[2^t t^{3/2} \ll c(r,t) \leq  t^{t^{2t^2}}\]

<p>for fixed $r$ and large $t$. In this talk, I will present a result that shows that, for fixed $r$ and large $t$, the order of magnitude of $c(r,t)$ is $4^t t^{-1/2}$, and moreover gives information about the dependence on $r$. I will also discuss another result, which states that all the extremal graphs are blow-ups of some small graph.</p>

<p>The problem of estimating $c(r,t)$ turns out to be intimately related to a celebrated result in extremal set theory known as the Two Families Theorem. There are several different versions of this theorem. I will discuss some of these and present a new version of the theorem which is needed in the proofs.</p>

      <h2>Speeding up random walk mixing by starting from a uniform vertex</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>The theory of rapid mixing random walks plays a fundamental role in the study of modern randomised algorithms. Usually, the mixing time is measured with respect to the worst initial position. It is well known that the presence of bottlenecks in a graph hampers mixing and, in particular, starting inside a small bottleneck significantly slows down the diffusion of the walk in the first steps of the process. To circumvent this problem, the average mixing time is defined to be the mixing time starting at a uniformly random vertex.</p>

<p>In this talk we discuss a general framework to show logarithmic average mixing time for random walks on graphs with small bottlenecks. The framework is especially effective on certain families of random graphs with heterogeneous properties. We demonstrate its applicability on two random models for which the mixing time was known to be of order $\log^2n$, speeding up the mixing to order $\log n$. First, in the context of smoothed analysis on connected graphs, we show logarithmic average mixing time for randomly perturbed graphs of bounded degeneracy. A particular instance is the Newman-Watts small-world model. Second, we show logarithmic average mixing time for supercritically percolated expander graphs. When the host graph is complete, this application gives an alternative proof that the average mixing time of the giant component in the supercritical Erdős-Rényi graph is logarithmic.</p>

We will establish that if a polynomial $P:\mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{F}_p$ with degree $d$ is such that the image $P(S^n)$ does not contain the full image $A(\mathbb{F}_p)$ of any non-constant polynomial $A: \mathbb{F}_p \to \mathbb{F}_p$ with degree at most $t$, then $P$ coincides on $S^n$ with a polynomial $Q$ that can be decomposed as a sum of a bounded number of polynomials which each have degree at most $d$ and are products of polynomials that have degrees at most $\lfloor d/(t+1) \rfloor$. In particular the polynomial $Q$ has bounded degree-$\lfloor d/(t+1) \rfloor$-rank in the sense of Green and Tao. Likewise, we will prove that if the assumption holds even for $t=d$ then $P$ coincides on $S^n$ with a polynomial with degree at most $d$ and depending only on a bounded number of variables.</p>

      <p><p>Abstract: In the euclidean space setting, symmetrization inequalities have been quite useful in solving problems coming from various parts of analysis: spectral geometry, variational problems, mathematical physics, spectral theory, to name a few. This theory is very classical and a lot is known in the continuum. In my talk, I will discuss about discrete analogues of these inequalities on graphs. This is a fairly new topic, and there is hardly anything known in this setting. I will talk about recent developments that has happened in the last one year, connections of this theory with different types of isoperimetric inequalities on graphs. Apart from general theory, I will present some concrete results for standard graph on $2d$ integer lattices. The talk will be at the interface of discrete math and analysis, and will be  based on a joint work with Stefan Steinerberger: <a href="https://www.arXiv.org/abs/2212.07590"> arXiv:2212.07590</a>.</p>

The limit tournamenton is naturally related to the spectrum of a certain skew-symmetric operator (e.g. a kernel). Our results answer a pair of questions of Conrey, Gabbard, Grant, Liu, and Morrison in the multiset model and substantially extend (and sharpen) recent works of Polymath and Cornacchia and Hązła which considered the balanced sequence model (and a continuous analog). The focus of the talk will be on local limit methods, associated heuristics, and when they may be useful in combinatorial settings.</p>

      <br>
      <p><p>In 1985, Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp showed that for every graph $H$ with chromatic number $k$ and every bounded degree tree $T$ of size $\Omega(|H|^4)$, the Ramsey number $R(T,H)$ is $(k-1)(|T|-1)+\sigma(H)$, where $\sigma(H)$ is the size of the smallest colour class across all proper $k$-colourings of $H$.  In this talk, I will present a quantitative improvement on this result, showing that $R(T,H)=(k-1)(|T|-1)+\sigma(H)$ for every tree $T$ of size $\Omega(|H|)$ and bounded maximum degree. This result is tight and confirms a conjecture of Balla, Pokrovskiy, and Sudakov.

      <h2>Distinct degrees and homogeneous sets</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>In this talk I will discuss some recent work examining the extremal relationship between two well-studied graph parameters: the order of the largest homogeneous set in a graph $G$ and the maximal number of distinct degrees appearing in an induced subgraph of $G$, denoted respectively by $\mathrm{hom}(G)$ and $f(G)$.</p>

<p>Our main theorem improves estimates due to Bukh and Sudakov and to Narayanan and Tomon and shows that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with $\mathrm{hom} (G)$ at least $n^{1/2}$ then $f(G) &gt; ( n / \mathrm{hom} (G) )^{1 - o(1)}$. The bound here is sharp up to the $o(1)$-term, and asymptotically solves a conjecture of Narayanan and Tomon. In particular, this implies that $\max ( \mathrm{hom} (G), f(G) ) &gt; n^{1/2 -o(1)}$ for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, which is also sharp.</p>

<p>The relationship between these parameters is known to change when $\mathrm{hom}(G) &lt; n^{1/2}$. I hope to discuss the suspected relationship in this other region, along with supporting results.</p>

      <h2>Hamilton decompositions of regular bipartite tournaments</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>A <em>regular bipartite tournament</em> is an orientation of a complete
balanced bipartite graph $K_{2n,2n}$ where every vertex has its in- and
outdegree both equal to $n$. In 1981, Jackson conjectured that any
regular bipartite tournament can be decomposed into Hamilton cycles. We
prove this conjecture for sufficiently large $n$. Along the way, we also
prove several further results, including a conjecture of Liebenau and
Pehova on Hamilton decompositions of dense bipartite digraphs.</p>

      <br>
      <p><p>A factorisation $x = u_1u_2\ldots$ of an infinite word $x$ on alphabet $X$ is called ‘super-monochromatic’, for a given colouring of the finite
words $X^∗$ on alphabet $X$, if each word $u_{k_1} u_{k_2} \ldots u_{k_n}$, where $k_1 &lt; · · · &lt; k_n$,
is the same colour. A direct application of Hindman’s theorem shows that
if $x$ is eventually periodic, then for every finite colouring of $X^∗$, there exist a suffix of $x$ that admits a super-monochromatic factorisation. What
about the converse?
In this talk we show that the converse does indeed hold: thus a word $x$ is eventually periodic if and only if for every finite colouring of $X^∗$
there is a suffix of $x$ having a super-monochromatic factorisation. This
has been a conjecture in the community for some time. Our main tool
is a Ramsey result about alternating sums. This provides a strong link
between Ramsey theory and the combinatorics of infinite words.</p>

      <h2>A general approach to transversal versions of Dirac-type theorems</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Given a collection of hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}=(H_1, \ldots, H_m)$ with the same vertex set, an $m$-edge graph $F\subset \cup_{i\in [m]}H_i$ is a transversal if there is a bijection $\phi:E(F)\to [m]$ such that $e\in E(H_{\phi(e)})$ for each $e\in E(F)$. How large does the minimum degree of each $H_i$ need to be so that $\mathcal{H}$ necessarily contains a copy of $F$ that is a transversal? Each $H_i$ in the collection could be the same hypergraph, hence the minimum degree of each $H_i$ needs to be large enough to ensure that $F\subseteq H_i$. Since its general introduction by Joos and Kim, a growing body of work has shown that in many cases, this lower bound is tight. In this paper, we give a unified approach to this problem by giving a widely applicable sufficient condition for this lower bound to be asymptotically tight. This is general enough to recover many previous results in the area and obtain novel transversal variants of several classical Dirac-type results for (powers of) Hamiltn cycles. For example, we derive that any collection of $2n$ graphs on an $n$-vertex set, each with minimum degree at least $(2/3+o(1))n$, contains a transversal copy of the square of a Hamilton cycle. This can be viewed as a rainbow version of Pósa’s conjecture.</p>

This improves the previous upper bound of $s_r(K_k) = O(k^6 r^3)$ proved by Fox et al. The construction used in our proof relies on a group theoretic model of generalised quadrangles introduced by Kantor in 1980.</p>

      <h2>Independent sets in random subgraphs of the hypercube</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Independent sets in bipartite regular graphs have been studied extensively in combinatorics, probability, computer science and more. The problem of counting independent sets is particularly interesting in the $d$-dimensional hypercube {$0,1$}$^d$, motivated by the lattice gas hardcore model from statistical physics. Independent sets also turn out to be very interesting in the context of random graphs.</p>

<p>The number of independent sets in the hypercube {$0,1$}$^d$ was estimated precisely by Korshunov and Sapozhenko in the 1980s and recently refined by Jenssen and Perkins.</p>

<p>In this talk we will discuss new results on the number of independent sets in a random subgraph of the hypercube. The results extend to the hardcore model and rely on an analysis of the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the hypercube.</p>

      <h2>Counting Hamiltonian cycles in Dirac hypergraphs.</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>For $0 \le r &lt; k$, a Hamiltonian $r$-cycle in a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ is a cyclic ordering of the vertices of $H$ in which the edges are segments of length $k$ and every two consecutive edges overlap in exactly $r$ vertices.
We show that for all $0 \le r &lt; k-1$, every Dirac $k$-graph, that is, a $k$-graph with minimum co-degree $pn$ for some $p&gt;1/2$, has (up to a subexponential factor) at least as many Hamiltonian $r$-cycles as a typical random $k$-graph with edge-probability p.
This improves a recent result of Glock, Gould, Joos, Osthus and Kühn, and verifies a conjecture of Ferber, Krivelevich and Sudakov for all values $0 \le r &lt; k-1$.

We prove the corresponding result for directed graphs. That is, we show that for sufficiently large $n$, every $n$-vertex directed graph with minimum semidegree at least $n/2 + o(n)$ contains a copy of every $n$-vertex oriented tree whose underlying maximum degree is at most $O(n/\log n)$. This improves a recent result of Mycroft and Naia, which requires the oriented trees to have underlying maximum degree at most $\Delta$, for any constant $\Delta$ and sufficiently large $n$.</p>

      <h2>Generalisations of a light switch problem</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Given any graph with lights turned on at each vertex and buttons corresponding to each vertex that toggle the status (on/off) of the vertex together with its neighbourhood, is there always a sequence of button-pushes that turns all of the lights off? This puzzle is answered by a folklore result of Gallai on partitioning the vertex set of a graph into two parts, each inducing a subgraph with specified degree parity conditions. A natural follow-up is to consider partitions satisfying prescribed degree congruence conditions modulo $q$. Recently, Ferber, Hardiman and Krivelevich showed that, for any $0\leq x &lt;q$, almost every $G_{n,1/2}$ has a vertex partition into $q+1$ parts such that each induced subgraph has degrees $x \bmod q$, and asked whether the same holds with $q$ parts. In this talk, we outline why this is not the case; in fact, the distribution of the counts of such `good’ partitions into $q$ parts is asymptotically Poisson. This is joint work with Paul Balister, Emil Powierski and Alex Scott.</p>

odd. Recently, Keevash, Pokrovskiy, Sudakov and Yepremyan broke a
long-standing bound on this problem by showing that every Latin square
of order $n$ has a transversal with $n-O(\log n/\log \log n)$ cells.</p>

may be infinite but one still would like to characterize all unavoidable sub-structures. For example, the

of $[N]$ there exist either arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions or arbitrarily long rainbow
arithmetic progressions. In this talk, we shall talk about a canonical version of the polynomial Van der

      <br>
      <p><p>The $n$-queens problem asks how many ways there are to place $n$ queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard so that no two queens can attack one another, and the toroidal $n$-queens problem asks the same question where the board is considered on the surface of a torus. Let $Q(n)$ denote the number of $n$-queens configurations on the classical board and $T(n)$ the number of toroidal $n$-queens configurations. The toroidal problem was first studied in 1918 by Pólya who showed that $T(n)&gt;0$ if and only if $n \equiv 1,5 \mod 6$. Much more recently Luria showed that $T(n)\leq ((1+o(1))ne^{-3})^n$ and conjectured equality when $n \equiv 1,5 \mod 6$. We prove this conjecture, prior to which no non-trivial lower bounds were known to hold for all (sufficiently large) $n \equiv 1,5 \mod 6$. We also show that $Q(n)\geq((1+o(1))ne^{-3})^n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ which was independently proved by Luria and Simkin and, combined with our toroidal result, completely settles a conjecture of Rivin, Vardi and Zimmermn regarding both $Q(n)$ and $T(n)$.</p>

<p>In this talk we’ll discuss our methods used to prove these results. A crucial element of this is translating the problem to one of counting matchings in a $4$-partite $4$-uniform hypergraph. Our strategy combines a random greedy algorithm to count `almost’ configurations with a complex absorbing strategy that uses ideas from the methods of randomised algebraic construction and iterative absorption.</p>

      <br>
      <p><p>Consider the following card guessing game introduced by Diaconis and Graham (1981): there is a shuffled deck of $mn$ cards with n distinct cards appearing with multiplicity $m$. In each round, the player has to guess the top card of the deck, and is then told whether the guess was correct or not, the top card is then discarded and then the game continues with the next card. This is known as the partial feedback model. The aim is maximise the number of correct guesses. One possible strategy is the shifting strategy in which the player keeps guessing $1$ every round until the guess is correct in some round, and then keeps guessing $2$, and then $3$ and so on. We are interested in finding the expected score using this strategy.</p>

<p>We can restate this problem as finding the expected length of the longest increasing subsequence of the form $123\ldots i$ in a word formed using letters $1$ to $n$ where each letter occurs with multiplicity $m$. In this talk, we show that this number is $m+1 - 1/(m+2)$ plus an exponential error term. This settles a conjecture of Diaconis, Graham, He and Spiro.</p>

      <p><p>Let \(H_1, ..., H_r\) be graphs. We write  \(G(n,p) \to (H_1, ..., H_r)\) to denote the property that whenever we colour the edges of \(G(n,p)\) with colours from the set \([r] := \{1, ..., r\}\) there exists some \(1 \leq i \leq r\) and a copy of \(H_i\) in \(G(n,p)\) monochromatic in colour \(i\).</p>

<p>There has been much interest in determining the asymptotic threshold function for this property. Rödl and Ruciński (1995) determined the threshold function for the general symmetric case; that is, when $H_1=\cdots =H_r$. A conjecture of Kohayakawa and Kreuter (1997), if true, would effectively resolve the asymmetric problem. Recently, the 1-statement of this conjecture was confirmed by Mousset, Nenadov and Samotij (2021+). The 0-statement however has only been proved for pairs of cycles, pairs of cliques and pairs of a clique and a cycle.</p>

<p>In this talk we introduce a reduction of the 0-statement of Kohayakawa and Kreuter’s conjecture to a certain deterministic, natural subproblem. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, we show this subproblem can be resolved for almost all pairs of regular graphs (satisfying properties one can assume when proving the 0-statement).</p>

<p>A linear system $L$ over $\mathcal{F}_q$ is common if the number of monochromatic solutions to $L=0$ in any two-colouring of $\mathcal{F}_q^n$ is asymptotically at least the expected number of monochromatic solutions in a random two-colouring of $\mathcal{F}_q^n$. Motivated by existing results for specific systems (such as Schur triples and arithmetic progressions), as well as extensive research on common and Sidorenko graphs, the systematic study of common systems of linear equations was recently initiated by Saad and Wolf. Fox, Pham and Zhao characterised common linear equations.</p>

<p>I will talk about recent progress towards a classification of common systems of two or more linear equations. In particular, the uncommonness of an arbitrarily large system $L$ can be reduced to studying single equations implied by $L$.</p>
