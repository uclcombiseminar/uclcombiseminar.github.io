      <h2>Hypergraph jumps and non-jumps</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p><strong>Venue</strong>: <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/estates/roombooking/building-location/?id=056" target="_blank">LG16 Seminar Room, Bentham House</a>.</p>

<p>An $r$-uniform hypergraph, or $r$-graph, has density $|E(G)|/\big|V(G)^{(r)}\big|$. We say $\alpha$ is a jump for $r$-graphs if there is some constant $\delta=\delta(\alpha)$ such that, for each $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $n\geqslant r$, any sufficiently large $r$-graph of density at least $\varepsilon$ has a subgraph of order $n$ and density at least $\alpha+\delta$. For $r=2$, all $\alpha$ are jumps. For $r\geqslant 3$, Erdős showed all $\big[0,\frac{r!}{r^r}\big)$ are jumps, and conjectured all $[0,1)$ are jumps. Since then, a variety of non-jumps have been proven, using a method introduced by Frankl and Rödl.</p>

<p>Our aim is to provide a general setting for this method. As an application, we prove several new non-jumps, which are smaller than any previously known. We also demonstrate that these are the smallest the current method can prove.</p>

      <h2>On the upper tail problem for irregular graphs</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p><strong>Venue</strong>: <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/15703989" target="_blank">Drayton House, Jevons Lecture Theatre B20</a>.</p>

<p>For a graph $H$, let $X_H$ denote the random variable counting the number of (unlabeled) copies of $H$ in $G_{n,p}$.
The study of this random variable goes back to the early works of Erdős–Rényi and its typical deviations are well understood.
In this talk, we will discuss the large deviations of $X_H$. In particular, we will be interested in the upper tail problem, that is—what is the upper tail probability of $H$, namely, $\Pr(X_H &gt; (1+\delta)E[X_H])$?</p>

<p>The upper tail problem proved to be very difficult, and even when $H$ is the triangle, the asymptotics of the logarithm of the upper tail probability, was solved only quite recently, by a breakthrough due to Harel, Mousset and Samotij.
More generally, together with a follow up result of Basak and Basu, the asymptotic value of the logarithm of the upper tail probability was resolved for any regular graph $H$.</p>

<p>Throughout the talk, first we will discuss the known results in the field, and the difficulties in extending their proofs for irregular graphs when $p$ is small.
Then, we will present an improvement for the state of the art theorem of Cook, Dembo and Pham, by estimating the logarithm of the upper tail probability of any irregular graph $H$, for sparser values of $p$, some of which are optimal.</p>

<p>The talk will be based on a joint work with Matan Harel, Frank Mousset and Wojciech Samotij.</p>

      <h2>Many cycle lengths in degree-critical graphs and path lengths in trees</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>A degree-3 critical graph is an $n$-vertex graph with $2n-2$ edges and no proper induced subgraph of minimum degree at least $3$.
Proving a conjecture of Narins, Pokrovskiy and Szabó up to a constant factor, we show that every degree $3$-critical graph contains cycles of at least $\log n$ many different lengths.
We also resolve two closely related conjectures of the same authors about trees: we prove that any $n$-vertex tree of maximum degree $\Delta$ has at least as many distinct leaf-to-leaf distances as the balanced $\Delta$-ary tree of the same order; and construct trees in which the set of these distances is “spread out” in a suitable sense.</p>

      <h2>Tight upper bound on the clique size in the square of 2-degenerate graphs</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>The square of a graph $G$, denoted $G^2$, has the same vertex set as $G$ and has an edge between two vertices if the distance between them in $G$ is at most $2$. In general, $\Delta(G) + 1 \leqslant \chi(G^2) \leqslant \Delta(G)^2+1$ for every graph $G$. Charpentier posed the question of whether $\chi(G^2) \leqslant 2\Delta(G)$ if the maximum average degree of $G$ is less than $4$. Cranston and Yu proved that $\omega(G^2) \leqslant 5\Delta(G)/2+72$ if $G$ is a $2$-degenerate graph. We modified their result by showing that if $G$ is a $2$-degenerate graph with $\Delta(G)$ sufficiently large, then $\omega(G^2) \leqslant5\Delta(G)/2$. Moreover, this bound is tight. </p>

      <h2>The distribution of the maximum protection number in random trees</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>The protection number of a vertex $v$ is the length of the shortest path from $v$ to any leaf contained in the maximal subtree where $v$ is the root. In this joint work with Clemens Heuberger and Stephan Wagner, we study the maximum protection number in simply generated trees using techniques from analytic combinatorics. We develop new methods with which to study generating functions dependent on multiple parameters, and obtain the distribution for the maximum protection number by applying them.</p>

      <h2>Discrepancy problems for spanning trees in colourings of $K_n$</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Erdos, Füredi, Loebl and Sós proved in 1995 that for a tree $T$ on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $\Delta$, any red-blue colouring of $K_n$ contains a copy of $T$ where one colour appears on $c(n−1−\Delta)$ more edges than the other.</p>

<p>We answer a question of Erdos, Füredi, Loebl and Sós, generalising their result to $r$ colours. We prove that for a fixed tree $T$ and an $r$-colouring of K_n, for any colour $i$ there is a copy of $T$ where the colour $i$ is over-represented compared to its density in the colouring. We also discuss further related questions and prove other generalisations to $r$ colours.</p>

      <h2>Towards an information-theoretic understanding of probabilistic universality</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>In probability and statistical physics, one class of results that is regularly aimed for is that of universality theorems. These results, starting with the central limit theorem, informally state that if the microscopic components of a system are not very dependent, have somewhat similar behaviour and have reasonable behaviour, then the behaviour of the macroscopic system may be described in a simple way regardless of how complex the microscopic behaviour is. The central limit theorem itself has been given entropy-based proofs and has been given an interpretation akin to the second law of thermodynamics: the entropies of the normalised partial sums are non-decreasing and converge to the maximal possible entropy subject to the variance constraint. Even the central limit theorem has however not been understood completely satisfactorily in this way until recently, as the monotonicity of entropy was first established by Artstein, Ball, Barthe, and Naor in 2004 and then given a simplified proof by Courtade in 2016. After discussing the central limit theorem, we will present some reasons to believe that information-theoretic tools could provide a natural framework for the proofs of other universality theorems.</p>

      <h2>Colouring graphs and generalised chromatic polynomials</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>For a graph $G$, the $k$-colouring graph $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ has vertices corresponding to proper $k$-colourings of $G$, and edges between colourings that differ at a single vertex of $G$. The chromatic polynomial can then be thought of as a function that enumerates the number of vertices in $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$ for each $k$. By instead counting instances of other induced subgraphs in $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$, Asgarli, Krehbiel, Levinson and Russell define the family of generalised chromatic polynomials. In this talk we will discuss some properties of the $k$-colouring graph and of generalised chromatic polynomials. This is based on joint work with Alex Scott, Youri Tamitegama and Jane Tan. </p>

      <h2>Double-jump phase transitions for the reverse Littlewood-Offord problem</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>An old conjecture of Erdős asks, given n unit vectors in dimension d, for a lower bound on the probability that a random signed sum of these unit vectors (taken uniformly at random from the $2^n$ possibilities) lies close to the origin. This conjecture has been corrected, solved, rediscovered and generalised over the years, and so it might appear that there is little more to say about it. However, in this talk we discuss adding a parity condition to $n$, a condition which both adds significant depth to the setting and gives new life to Erdős’s original conjecture, giving rise to a wealth of interesting results and wide-open problems. We will also say a few words about optimal constructions in the original setting of Erdős, about which much also remains mysterious.</p>

      <h2>Reconstructing a large subset of a point set in $\mathbb{R}$ from incomplete distance information</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Let $V$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}$, and let $\epsilon &gt; 0$ be a small enough fixed constant. Suppose the distances between each pair of points are revealed according to an Erdős–Rényi random graph $G(n,(1+\epsilon)/n)$, meaning that the distance between any two points is revealed independently with probability $p=\frac{1+\epsilon}{n}$. We show that, with high probability, this information is sufficient to reconstruct, up to isometry, a subset of $V$ of size $\Omega_{\epsilon}(n)$. This confirms a conjecture of Girao, Illingworth, Michel, Powierski, and Scott. Our approach involves proving certain structural properties of the $2$-core of $G(n,(1+\epsilon)/n)$, which can be of independent interest. 
In the deterministic setting, Benjamini and Tzalik conjectured that, if the pairwise distances of $V$ are revealed according to the edges of an arbitrary graph $G=(V,E)$, then one can always reconstruct a subset of $\Omega(\frac{|E|}{|V|})$ points. We disprove this conjecture, but show, using a density increment type argument, that one can always reconstruct a subset of size $\frac{|E|e^{-\alpha \sqrt{\log |V|}}}{|V|}$, for some absolute constant $\alpha &gt;0$.</p>

      <h2>The Turán density of the tight 5-cycle minus one edge</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>This is joint work with Bodnar, Liu and Pikhurko. Results similar to ours were independently obtained by Lidický, Mattes and Pfender.</p>

<p>The tight $\ell$-cycle minus one edge $C_\ell^{3-}$ is the $3$-graph on ${1,\dots,\ell}$ consisting of $\ell-1$ consecutive triples in cyclic order. We show that, for every $\ell\geqslant 5$ not divisible by $3$, the Turán density of $C_{\ell}^{3-}$ is $1/4$, and also show a stability and a finer structure result. This proves a conjecture of Mubayi, Sudakov and Pikhurko from 2011 and extends the results of Balogh and Luo, who established analogous claims for all sufficiently large $\ell$. In this talk, I will present the idea behind the main proof.</p>

      <h2>Ramsey Number of Trees</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Given a graph $G$, the Ramsey number $R(G)$ is defined to be the smallest $N$ such that any red/blue colouring of the complete graph $K_N$ contains a monochromatic copy of $G$. For a tree $T$ whose bipartition classes have sizes $t_1\geqslant t_2$, two simple constructions shows that $R(T)\geqslant R_B(T):=\max(t_1+2t_2,2t_1)-1$, and Burr conjectured in 1974 that $R(T)=R_B(T)$.</p>

<p> It has been shown that Burr’s conjecture is false for certain trees called the double stars, though all of these known counterexamples have large maximum degrees. In 2002, Haxell, Łuczak and Tingley showed that an approximate version of Burr’s conjecture is true if one imposes a maximum degree condition. In an upcoming joint work with Richard Montgomery and Matías Pavez-Signé, we prove that Burr’s conjecture is true for all trees with up to small linear maximum degrees. That is, there exists $c&gt;0$ such that for all trees $T$ on $n$ vertices with $\Delta(T)\leqslant cn$, $R(T)=R_B(T)$.</p>

      <h2>Upper bounds on Ramsey Numbers</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>The $r$-colour Ramsey number $R_r(k)$ is the minimum $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that every $r$-colouring of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices contains a monochromatic copy of $K_k$. We prove, for each fixed $r\geqslant 2$, that \(R_r(k) \leqslant e^{-\delta k} r^{rk}\) for some constant $\delta = \delta(r) &gt; 0$ and all sufficiently large $k \in \mathbb{N}$. For each $r \geqslant 3$, this is the first exponential improvement over the upper bound of Erdős and Szekeres from 1935. In the case $r = 2$, it gives a different  proof of a recent result of Campos, Griffiths, Morris and Sahasrabudhe. This is based on joint work with Paul Balister, Béla Bollobás, Marcelo Campos, Simon Griffiths, Eoin Hurley, Robert Morris and Julian Sahasrabudhe.</p>

      <h2>A two-player voting game in Euclidean space</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Suppose we fix a finite collection $S$ of points in $\mathbb R^d$, which we regard as the locations of voters. Two players (candidates), Alice and Bob, are playing the following game. Alice goes first and chooses any point $A$ in $\mathbb R^d$. Bob can then choose any point $B$ in $\mathbb R^d$, knowing what $A$ is. A voter $V$ positioned at $x$ will vote for Alice (resp. Bob) if $d(x,A)&lt;d(x,B)$ (resp. $d(x,B)&lt;d(x,A)$), where $d$ denotes Euclidean distance. If $x$ is equidistant from $A$ and $B$, $V$ will not vote for anyone. The candidate with the greatest number of votes wins. If they both get the same number of votes, then (by convention) Alice is declared the winner.</p>

<p> When $d=1$, it is easy to see that Alice can always win this game by choosing $A$ to be the median of $S$. This observation was first made by Hotelling in the 1920s; he referred to this model (in one dimension) as the Median Voter Model. When $d &gt; 1$ however, the game is sometimes an Alice win and sometimes a Bob win, depending on the structure of $S$. We completely characterise the sets $S$ for which Alice wins in dimensions $&gt; 1$, showing that the game is usually won by Bob, unless $S$ has a specific structure.</p>

      <h2>Monochromatic tight cycle partitions in edge-coloured complete k-graphs</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Let $K_n^{(k)}$ be the complete $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices. A tight cycle is a $k$-uniform graph with its vertices cyclically ordered so that every $k$ consecutive vertices form an edge, and any two consecutive edges share exactly $k-1$ vertices. A result by Bustamante, Corsten, Frankl, Pokrovskiy and Skokan shows that all $r$-edge coloured $K_{n}^{(k)}$ can be partition into $c_{r,k}$ vertex disjoint monochromatic tight cycles. However, the constant $c_{r,k}$ is of tower-type. In this work, we show that $c_{r,k}$ is a polynomial in $r$. </p>

      <p><p>It is fairly easy to prove that every finite poset can be viewed as a subposet of $(2^{[N]},\subseteq)$ for sufficiently large $N$. The width of such a subposet is the size of its largest empty subposet. Clearly, sets of equal size in $2^{[N]}$ are incomparable, thus forming an empty subposet. In other words, layers are antichains. We demonstrate how a certain symmetry of the subposet is conducive to showing that its maximal antichain is the largest layer.</p>

      <h2>Colour-bias perfect matchings in hypergraphs</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Given a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ and an $r$-colouring of its edges, 
we look for a minimum $l$-degree condition that guarantees the existence 
of a perfect matching in $H$ that has significantly more than $n/rk$ edges in one colour. 
We refer to it as a colour-bias perfect matching.
For $2$-coloured graphs, a result of Balogh, Csaba, Jing and Pluhár yields the 
minimum degree threshold that ensures a perfect matching of significant colour-bias. 
In this talk, I will present an analogous of this result for $k$-uniform hypergraphs. 
More precisely, for each $2 \le l &lt; k$ and $r \ge 2$ we determined the minimum $l$-degree 
threshold for forcing a perfect matching of significant colour-bias in an $r$-coloured $k$-uniform hypergraph.</p>

      <h2>Minimal families of shattering permutations</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Let $n, t, k$ be positive integers and say that a family $\mathcal{P}$ of permutations is $(k,t)$-shattering for $[n]=\set{1,\dotsc, n}$ if it induces at least $t$ distinct orders on each $k$-subset of $[n]$.
In 1971, Spencer constructed $(k,k)$-shattering families of size $O(\log \log n)$ and showed that $(k,k!)$-shattering families have size $\Omega(\log n)$.</p>

<p>Füredi then asked in 1996 whether minimal $(k,t)$-shattering families always have sizes in one of three regimes: $O(1)$, $\Theta(\log \log n)$, $\Theta(\log n)$.
In 2023, Johnson and Wickes settled the case $k=3$ affirmatively and asked whether this could be extended to general $k$.
In recent joint work with António Girão and Lukas Michel show the existence of a jump between the $\Theta(\log \log n)$ regime and a new $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$ regime when $k\geq 4$, thereby answering both the general question of Füredi and the question of Johnson and Wickes negatively.
Moreover, we settle the case $k=4$ and greatly narrow the range of $t$ for which asymptotic sizes of such families are unknown.</p>

      <h2>Improved bounds for Chowla's conjecture with logarithmic weights</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>The Liouville function $\lambda(n)$ is defined to be +1 if n is a product of an even number of primes, and -1 otherwise. In many ways, the Liouville function is expected to behave like a random sequence of +1’s and -1’s. Instances of this phenomenon are intimately connected with the distribution of primes. For instance, the statement that the partial sums of the Liouville function grow no faster than $x^{1/2+\epsilon}$ is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis. The two-point Chowla conjecture predicts that the average of $\lambda(n)\lambda(n+1)$ over $n\leq x$ tends to zero as $x\to \infty$. I will present my work on a logarithmically weighted version of this problem. The proof uses elementary combinatorics to study a graph encoding number-theoretic information.</p>

      <br>
      <p><p>One of the first results in extremal graph theory is Turán’s
theorem, which states that the Turán graph $T(n,r)$ 
maximizes the number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that 
does not contain $K_{r+1}$ as a subgraph. More generally, 
given two graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Turán number 
$ex(n, H, F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in an 
$n$-vertex $F$-free graph and such graphs with $ex(n, H, F)$ 
copies of $H$ are called extremal graphs. 
For fixed $H$, $F=K_{r+1}$ and $r$ large enough, 
we recently showed in a joint work with Morrison, Nir, Norine, 
and Rzążewski, that the extremal graph for the 
generalized Turán problem is the Turán graph  $T(n,r)$. 
This talk discusses this result and more broadly, 
results on generalized Turán numbers.</p>

      <p><p>A regular $k$-partite tournament is a regular orientation 
of the balanced complete $k$-partite graph. Kühn and Osthus proved 
that for all $k \ge 4$ any large enough regular $k$-partite tournament 
can be decomposed into edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles and conjectured 
the same to be true for all $k$. 
Granet proved the conjecture for $k=2$ and, somewhat surprisingly, 
gave a construction of a non-Hamilton decomposable regular tripartite tournament. 
Our main result is a proof that an approximate version of the conjecture still holds
for $k=3$, i.e. that in each such large tournament one may find edge-disjoint 
Hamilton cycles covering all but $o(n^2)$ edges. We also prove that if $a &gt; 1/3$,
any balanced regular tripartite digraph with minimum semidegree at least $a*n$ is Hamilton decomposable.</p>

      <h2>Bandwidth theorem for graph transversals</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>The bandwidth of a graph is the minimum $b$ such that 
there is a labeling of the vertex set of $H$ by 
the numbers $1,2,\ldots,n$ with $|i-j|\le b$ 
for every edge $ij$ of $H$. The celebrated bandwidth theorem
states that if $H$ is an $n$-vertex graph with chromatic number $r$,
bounded maximum degree, and bandwidth $o(n)$, then every $n$-vertex 
graph with minimum degree at least $\left(1-\frac{1}{r}+o(1)\right)n$ 
contains a copy of $H$. This minimum degree is best possible up to the $o(1)$ term.</p>

<p>Recently, there have been systematic studies extending spanning subgraph problems
to the setting of transversals over a collection of graphs. 
Given a graph-collection $\mathcal{G}={G_1,\dots, G_h}$ with the same vertex set $V$,
an $h$-edge graph $H$ on the vertex set $V$ is a $\mathcal{G}$-transversal 
if there exists a bijection $\lambda : E(H) \rightarrow {1,\ldots,h}$ such that 
$e\in E(G_{\lambda(e)})$ for each $e\in E(H)$. 
The minimum degree condition $\delta(\mathcal{G})=\min{ \delta(G_i)}$ 
for finding a spanning $\mathcal{G}$-transversal $H$ have been actively 
studied when $H$ is a Hamilton cycle, an $F$-factor, 
a tree with maximum degree $o(n/\log n)$, and power of Hamilton cycles, etc.</p>

<p>Generalizing both these results and the original bandwidth theorem, 
we obtain asymptotically sharp minimum degree conditions for graphs 
with bounded degree and sublinear bandwidth, proving the bandwidth theorem
for graph transversals. This talk is based on joint work 
with Seonghyuk Im, Jaehoon Kim, and Hong Liu.</p>

      <br>
      <p><p>We say that a graph $G$ is reconstructible from its $r$-neighbourhoods if all graphs $H$ having the same collection of $r$-balls as $G$ up to isomorphism, are isomorphic to $G$. We are interested in the reconstruction of the Erdős–Renyi random graph $G(n,p)$ for a wide range of values of $r$, aiming to determine the values of $p$ for which $G(n, p)$ is $r$-reconstructible with high probability.
Mossel and Ross showed that the the graph $G(n,p)$ can be reconstructed from its 3-neighbourhoods with high probability provided that $p \gg \log^2(n)/n$. Later, Gaudio and Mossel studied reconstruction from the 1- and 2-neighbourhoods, giving bounds on the values of $p$ for which $G(n,p)$ is reconsructible. For 1-neighbourhoods, this was improved very recently by Huang and Tikhomirov who determined the correct threshold up to logarithmic factors, around $n^{−1/2}$.
In this talk we will show new bounds on p for the $r$-reconstructibility problem in $G(n, p)$. We improve the bounds for 2-neighbourhoods given by Gaudio and Mossel by polynomial factors. We also improve the result of Huang and Tikhomirov for 1-neighbourhoods, showing that the logarithmic factor is necessary. Finally, we determine the exact thresholds for $r$-reconstructibility for $r \ge 3$.
If time permits, I will also discuss new related results on reconstruction of random directed graphs and random matrices.</p>

Following this, I will outline several broadly applicable conditions for the existence of rigid partitions and discuss a few applications, among which are new results on the rigidity of highly-connected, (pseudo)random graphs, and dense graphs. In particular, I will show that $Cd^2\log^2(n)$-connected $n$-vertex graphs are $d$-rigid, a result that can be viewed as a step towards the Lovász-Yemini conjecture, which states that $Cd^2$-connected graphs are $d$-rigid.</p>

Such a Hamilton cycle is called transversal, or rainbow. This result directly extends Dirac’s theorem, which can be deduced by taking all graphs in the collection to be isomorphic, and kick-started a systematic study of transversal problems in extremal combinatorics. We show that (asymptotically) the same degree condition guarantees not only a single rainbow Hamilton cycle, but in fact every rainbow Hamilton cycle. That is, if all $G_i$ have minimum degree $(1/2+\varepsilon)n$ for some small $\varepsilon$, then there is a Hamilton cycle $C=e_1…e_n$ whose edges $e_i$ are taken in the natural cyclic ordering, such that each $e_i$ is in $E(G_i)$.</p>

      <h2>Anti-concentration of Rademacher sums and Tomaszewski's counterpart problem</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>A Rademacher sum is a finite weighted sum of independent Rademacher random variables, that is $R=a_1\epsilon_1+\dots+a_n\epsilon_n$ 
where the $a_i$ are real constants and $\epsilon_i$ are picked independently and uniformly at random from ${-1,+1}$. 
Tomaszewski’s conjecture from 1986 states that every Rademacher sum $R$ of variance 1 satisfies $\mathbb{P}(|R| \leq 1) \geq 1/2$. This problem has attracted significant attention over the years before it was finally settled by Keller and Klein in 2020. 
Tomaszewski’s counterpart problem is concerned with determining $\inf \mathbb{P}(|R| \geq 1)$, where the infimum is taken over the class of Rademacher sums $R$ of variance 1. This problem has also received much attention over the years, with Hitczenko and Kwapień conjecturing in 1994 that the infimum is $7/32$. In this talk we confirm Hitczenko and Kwapień’s conjecture. In fact, our methods enable us to fully determine $f(y)= \inf \mathbb{P}(|R| \geq y\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(R)})$ where the infimum is taken over all Rademacher sums $R$, confirming a conjecture by Lowther and giving a partial answer to a question by Keller and Klein.</p>

      <h2>Packing the largest trees in the tree packing conjecture</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>The tree packing conjecture of Gyárfás from 1976 says that any sequence of trees $T_1,\ldots,T_n$ such that $|T_i|=i$ for each $i$ packs into $K_n$.
Packing even just the largest trees in such a sequence has proven difficult, with Bollobás drawing attention to this in 1995 by conjecturing that, for each $k$, if $n$ is sufficiently large then the largest $k$ trees in any such sequence can be packed. Despite many partial results and much related work on the full tree packing conjecture, even this weakening remained open. We prove Bollobás’s conjecture, by showing that, moreover, a linear number of the largest trees can be packed in the tree packing conjecture. Joint work with Richard Montgomery.</p>

<p>An infinite graph is quasi-transitive if its vertex set has finitely many orbits under the action of its automorphism group. We obtain a structure theorem for locally finite quasi-transitive graphs avoiding a minor, which is reminiscent of the Robertson-Seymour Graph Minor Structure Theorem. As applications of this result, we prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph attains its Hadwiger number, that is, if such a graph contains arbitrarily large clique minors, then it contains an infinite clique minor. This answers a question of Thomassen from 1992. We also derive some results on the accessibility of quasi-transitive graphs and groups avoiding a minor. Finally, we prove the minor-excluded case of a conjecture of Ballier and Stein (2018) on the domino problem.</p>

      <p><p>Scott and Seymour conjectured the existence of a function $f$ such that, for every graph $G$ and tournament $T$ on the same vertex set, $\chi(G)\geq f(k)$ implies that $\chi(G[N_T^+(v)])\geq k$ for some vertex $v$. We will disprove this conjecture even if $v$ is replaced by a vertex set of size $\mathcal{O}(\log{|V(G)|})$. 
As a consequence, we obtain a negative answer to a question of Harutyunyan, Le, Thomassé, and Wu concerning the analogous statement where the graph $G$ is replaced by another tournament. Time permitting, we will also discuss the setting in which chromatic number is replaced by degeneracy, where a quite different behaviour is exhibited.</p>

      <h2>$K_r$-saturated graphs with large minimum degree</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Given a graph $H$, we say that a graph $G$ is $H$-saturated if $G$ is maximally $H$-free, meaning $G$ contains no copy of $H$ but adding any new edge to $G$ creates a copy of $H$. The saturation problem is to determine the saturation number $\mathrm{sat}(n,H)$, the minimum number of edges in an $H$-saturated graph $G$ on $n$ vertices.  The saturation number of cliques was determined exactly by Erdős, Hajnal and Moon in the 60s. The problem becomes more interesting, however, if we additionally require the minimum degree of $G$ to be large.</p>

<p>Let $\mathrm{sat}(n,K_r,t)$ be the minimum number of edges in a $K_r$-saturated graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\delta(G) \geq t$. Day showed in 2017 that for fixed $r$ and $t$, $\mathrm{sat}(n,K_r,t)=tn-c(r,t)$ for large enough $n$, where $c(r,t)$ is a constant depending on $r$ and $t$. He raised the problem of estimating $c(r,t)$ and proved the estimates</p>

\[2^t t^{3/2} \ll c(r,t) \leq  t^{t^{2t^2}}\]

<p>for fixed $r$ and large $t$. In this talk, I will present a result that shows that, for fixed $r$ and large $t$, the order of magnitude of $c(r,t)$ is $4^t t^{-1/2}$, and moreover gives information about the dependence on $r$. I will also discuss another result, which states that all the extremal graphs are blow-ups of some small graph.</p>

<p>The problem of estimating $c(r,t)$ turns out to be intimately related to a celebrated result in extremal set theory known as the Two Families Theorem. There are several different versions of this theorem. I will discuss some of these and present a new version of the theorem which is needed in the proofs.</p>

      <h2>Speeding up random walk mixing by starting from a uniform vertex</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>The theory of rapid mixing random walks plays a fundamental role in the study of modern randomised algorithms. Usually, the mixing time is measured with respect to the worst initial position. It is well known that the presence of bottlenecks in a graph hampers mixing and, in particular, starting inside a small bottleneck significantly slows down the diffusion of the walk in the first steps of the process. To circumvent this problem, the average mixing time is defined to be the mixing time starting at a uniformly random vertex.</p>

<p>In this talk we discuss a general framework to show logarithmic average mixing time for random walks on graphs with small bottlenecks. The framework is especially effective on certain families of random graphs with heterogeneous properties. We demonstrate its applicability on two random models for which the mixing time was known to be of order $\log^2n$, speeding up the mixing to order $\log n$. First, in the context of smoothed analysis on connected graphs, we show logarithmic average mixing time for randomly perturbed graphs of bounded degeneracy. A particular instance is the Newman-Watts small-world model. Second, we show logarithmic average mixing time for supercritically percolated expander graphs. When the host graph is complete, this application gives an alternative proof that the average mixing time of the giant component in the supercritical Erdős-Rényi graph is logarithmic.</p>

We will establish that if a polynomial $P:\mathbb{F}_p^n \to \mathbb{F}_p$ with degree $d$ is such that the image $P(S^n)$ does not contain the full image $A(\mathbb{F}_p)$ of any non-constant polynomial $A: \mathbb{F}_p \to \mathbb{F}_p$ with degree at most $t$, then $P$ coincides on $S^n$ with a polynomial $Q$ that can be decomposed as a sum of a bounded number of polynomials which each have degree at most $d$ and are products of polynomials that have degrees at most $\lfloor d/(t+1) \rfloor$. In particular the polynomial $Q$ has bounded degree-$\lfloor d/(t+1) \rfloor$-rank in the sense of Green and Tao. Likewise, we will prove that if the assumption holds even for $t=d$ then $P$ coincides on $S^n$ with a polynomial with degree at most $d$ and depending only on a bounded number of variables.</p>

      <p><p>Abstract: In the euclidean space setting, symmetrization inequalities have been quite useful in solving problems coming from various parts of analysis: spectral geometry, variational problems, mathematical physics, spectral theory, to name a few. This theory is very classical and a lot is known in the continuum. In my talk, I will discuss about discrete analogues of these inequalities on graphs. This is a fairly new topic, and there is hardly anything known in this setting. I will talk about recent developments that has happened in the last one year, connections of this theory with different types of isoperimetric inequalities on graphs. Apart from general theory, I will present some concrete results for standard graph on $2d$ integer lattices. The talk will be at the interface of discrete math and analysis, and will be  based on a joint work with Stefan Steinerberger: <a href="https://www.arXiv.org/abs/2212.07590"> arXiv:2212.07590</a>.</p>

      <p><p>We consider tuples of $n$ sided dice drawn from either the multiset or balanced sequence model. Relying on Fourier based methods, we prove that the natural tournament associated to $n$ sided die converges to a limit tournamenton which while highly non-quasirandom exhibits numerous symmetries. The limit tournamenton is naturally related to the spectrum of a certain skew-symmetric operator (e.g. a kernel). Our results answer a pair of questions of Conrey, Gabbard, Grant, Liu, and Morrison in the multiset model and substantially extend (and sharpen) recent works of Polymath and Cornacchia and Hązła which considered the balanced sequence model (and a continuous analog). The focus of the talk will be on local limit methods, associated heuristics, and when they may be useful in combinatorial settings.</p>

      <br>
      <p><p>In 1985, Erdős, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp showed that for every graph $H$ with chromatic number $k$ and every bounded degree tree $T$ of size $\Omega(|H|^4)$, the Ramsey number $R(T,H)$ is $(k-1)(|T|-1)+\sigma(H)$, where $\sigma(H)$ is the size of the smallest colour class across all proper $k$-colourings of $H$.  In this talk, I will present a quantitative improvement on this result, showing that $R(T,H)=(k-1)(|T|-1)+\sigma(H)$ for every tree $T$ of size $\Omega(|H|)$ and bounded maximum degree. This result is tight and confirms a conjecture of Balla, Pokrovskiy, and Sudakov.

By imposing suitable regularity and/or connectivity conditions on graphs, one can lower the degree threshold at which a Hamilton cycle is guaranteed to appear, and this is quite well understood in the case of graphs. Conjectures of Kuhn and Osthus and of Jackson describe the corresponding situation for directed graphs and oriented graphs respectively. I will discuss approximate solutions to these conjectures.

<p>Our main theorem improves estimates due to Bukh and Sudakov and to Narayanan and Tomon and shows that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with $\mathrm{hom} (G)$ at least $n^{1/2}$ then $f(G) &gt; ( n / \mathrm{hom} (G) )^{1 - o(1)}$. The bound here is sharp up to the $o(1)$-term, and asymptotically solves a conjecture of Narayanan and Tomon. In particular, this implies that $\max ( \mathrm{hom} (G), f(G) ) &gt; n^{1/2 -o(1)}$ for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, which is also sharp.</p>

<p>The relationship between these parameters is known to change when $\mathrm{hom}(G) &lt; n^{1/2}$. I hope to discuss the suspected relationship in this other region, along with supporting results.</p>

if $x$ is eventually periodic, then for every finite colouring of $X^∗$, there exist a suffix of $x$ that admits a super-monochromatic factorisation. What

In this talk we show that the converse does indeed hold: thus a word $x$ is eventually periodic if and only if for every finite colouring of $X^∗$
there is a suffix of $x$ having a super-monochromatic factorisation. This
has been a conjecture in the community for some time. Our main tool

<p>Firstly, we revisit the classical connection between lattice paths, continued fractions, and orthogonal polynomials. Then, we discuss our ongoing research on an extension of this connection linking lattice paths, branched continued fractions, and multiple orthogonal polynomials. This work is part of a collaboration with Alan Sokal.</p>

      <h2>Optimal Impartial Selection</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>I will consider selection rules that map any directed graph (without loops) to a subset of its vertices. A selection rule is impartial if the selection of a vertex is independent of its outgoing edges, and an optimal impartial rule is one that in any graph selects vertices with large degrees. The idea is that vertices and edges represent individuals and nominations among invidiuals, and we want to select highly nominated individuals without individuals having an influence on their own selection. I will discuss what is know about impartial selection and point to some open problems.</p>

      <h2>A general approach to transversal versions of Dirac-type theorems</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Given a collection of hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}=(H_1, \ldots, H_m)$ with the same vertex set, an $m$-edge graph $F\subset \cup_{i\in [m]}H_i$ is a transversal if there is a bijection $\phi:E(F)\to [m]$ such that $e\in E(H_{\phi(e)})$ for each $e\in E(F)$. How large does the minimum degree of each $H_i$ need to be so that $\mathcal{H}$ necessarily contains a copy of $F$ that is a transversal? Each $H_i$ in the collection could be the same hypergraph, hence the minimum degree of each $H_i$ needs to be large enough to ensure that $F\subseteq H_i$. Since its general introduction by Joos and Kim, a growing body of work has shown that in many cases, this lower bound is tight. In this paper, we give a unified approach to this problem by giving a widely applicable sufficient condition for this lower bound to be asymptotically tight. This is general enough to recover many previous results in the area and obtain novel transversal variants of several classical Dirac-type results for (powers of) Hamiltn cycles. For example, we derive that any collection of $2n$ graphs on an $n$-vertex set, each with minimum degree at least $(2/3+o(1))n$, contains a transversal copy of the square of a Hamilton cycle. This can be viewed as a rainbow version of Pósa’s conjecture.</p>

      <br>
      <p><p>We will present a new upper bound of $s_r(K_k) = O(k^5 r^{5/2})$ on the Ramsey parameter $s_r(K_k)$ introduced by Burr, Erd<span>ő</span>s and Lovász in 1976, which is defined as the smallest minimum degree of a graph $G$ such that any $r$-colouring of the edges of $G$ contains a monochromatic $K_k$, whereas no proper subgraph of $G$ has this property. This improves the previous upper bound of $s_r(K_k) = O(k^6 r^3)$ proved by Fox et al. The construction used in our proof relies on a group theoretic model of generalised quadrangles introduced by Kantor in 1980.</p>

      <h2>Independent sets in random subgraphs of the hypercube</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Independent sets in bipartite regular graphs have been studied extensively in combinatorics, probability, computer science and more. The problem of counting independent sets is particularly interesting in the $d$-dimensional hypercube {$0,1$}$^d$, motivated by the lattice gas hardcore model from statistical physics. Independent sets also turn out to be very interesting in the context of random graphs.</p>

<p>The number of independent sets in the hypercube {$0,1$}$^d$ was estimated precisely by Korshunov and Sapozhenko in the 1980s and recently refined by Jenssen and Perkins.</p>

<p>In this talk we will discuss new results on the number of independent sets in a random subgraph of the hypercube. The results extend to the hardcore model and rely on an analysis of the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the hypercube.</p>

      <h2>Counting Hamiltonian cycles in Dirac hypergraphs.</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>For $0 \le r &lt; k$, a Hamiltonian $r$-cycle in a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ is a cyclic ordering of the vertices of $H$ in which the edges are segments of length $k$ and every two consecutive edges overlap in exactly $r$ vertices.
We show that for all $0 \le r &lt; k-1$, every Dirac $k$-graph, that is, a $k$-graph with minimum co-degree $pn$ for some $p&gt;1/2$, has (up to a subexponential factor) at least as many Hamiltonian $r$-cycles as a typical random $k$-graph with edge-probability p.
This improves a recent result of Glock, Gould, Joos, Osthus and Kühn, and verifies a conjecture of Ferber, Krivelevich and Sudakov for all values $0 \le r &lt; k-1$.

      <br>
      <p><p>In 2001, Komlós, Sárközy and Szemerédi proved that for sufficiently large $n$, every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $n/2 + o(n)$ contains a copy of every $n$-vertex tree with maximum degree at most $O(n/\log n)$. We prove the corresponding result for directed graphs. That is, we show that for sufficiently large $n$, every $n$-vertex directed graph with minimum semidegree at least $n/2 + o(n)$ contains a copy of every $n$-vertex oriented tree whose underlying maximum degree is at most $O(n/\log n)$. This improves a recent result of Mycroft and Naia, which requires the oriented trees to have underlying maximum degree at most $\Delta$, for any constant $\Delta$ and sufficiently large $n$.</p>

      <h2>Generalisations of a light switch problem</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Given any graph with lights turned on at each vertex and buttons corresponding to each vertex that toggle the status (on/off) of the vertex together with its neighbourhood, is there always a sequence of button-pushes that turns all of the lights off? This puzzle is answered by a folklore result of Gallai on partitioning the vertex set of a graph into two parts, each inducing a subgraph with specified degree parity conditions. A natural follow-up is to consider partitions satisfying prescribed degree congruence conditions modulo $q$. Recently, Ferber, Hardiman and Krivelevich showed that, for any $0\leq x &lt;q$, almost every $G_{n,1/2}$ has a vertex partition into $q+1$ parts such that each induced subgraph has degrees $x \bmod q$, and asked whether the same holds with $q$ parts. In this talk, we outline why this is not the case; in fact, the distribution of the counts of such `good’ partitions into $q$ parts is asymptotically Poisson. This is joint work with Paul Balister, Emil Powierski and Alex Scott.</p>

      <h2>On the Ryser-Brualdi-Stein Conjecture</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>A Latin square of order $n$ is an $n$ by $n$ grid filled with $n$ symbols, so
that every symbol appears exactly once in each row and each column. A
transversal of a Latin square is a collection of cells in the grid which
share no row, column or symbol.</p>

<p>The Ryser-Brualdi-Stein conjecture says that every Latin square of order
$n$ has a transversal with $n-1$ cells if $n$ is even and with $n$ cells if $n$ is
odd. Recently, Keevash, Pokrovskiy, Sudakov and Yepremyan broke a
long-standing bound on this problem by showing that every Latin square
of order $n$ has a transversal with $n-O(\log n/\log \log n)$ cells.</p>

<p>I will discuss how to make further progress on this problem, and in
particular the challenges of using absorption techniques in this setting.</p>

      <p><p>A well known theorem due to Van der Waerden and dating from 1927 states that in any finite
colouring of the natural numbers there exist arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions. Most
Ramsey-theoretical results (finite colourings) have a canonical version. In this setting, the palette of colours
may be infinite but one still would like to characterize all unavoidable sub-structures. For example, the
canonical Van der Waerden’s Theorem, first proved by Erdős and Graham, states that in any colouring
of $[N]$ there exist either arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions or arbitrarily long rainbow
arithmetic progressions. In this talk, we shall talk about a canonical version of the polynomial Van der
Waerden’s Theorem, originally proved by Bergelson and Liebman.</p>

At the heart of the proof is a combinatorial “decoupling” lemma which I suspect has applications well beyond the scope of our work.</p>

      <h2>The $n$-queens problem</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>The $n$-queens problem asks how many ways there are to place $n$ queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard so that no two queens can attack one another, and the toroidal $n$-queens problem asks the same question where the board is considered on the surface of a torus. Let $Q(n)$ denote the number of $n$-queens configurations on the classical board and $T(n)$ the number of toroidal $n$-queens configurations. The toroidal problem was first studied in 1918 by Pólya who showed that $T(n)&gt;0$ if and only if $n \equiv 1,5 \mod 6$. Much more recently Luria showed that $T(n)\leq ((1+o(1))ne^{-3})^n$ and conjectured equality when $n \equiv 1,5 \mod 6$. We prove this conjecture, prior to which no non-trivial lower bounds were known to hold for all (sufficiently large) $n \equiv 1,5 \mod 6$. We also show that $Q(n)\geq((1+o(1))ne^{-3})^n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ which was independently proved by Luria and Simkin and, combined with our toroidal result, completely settles a conjecture of Rivin, Vardi and Zimmermn regarding both $Q(n)$ and $T(n)$.</p>

<p>In this talk we’ll discuss our methods used to prove these results. A crucial element of this is translating the problem to one of counting matchings in a $4$-partite $4$-uniform hypergraph. Our strategy combines a random greedy algorithm to count `almost’ configurations with a complex absorbing strategy that uses ideas from the methods of randomised algebraic construction and iterative absorption.</p>

      <h2>Analysing a strategy for a card guessing game via continuously increasing subsequences in multiset permutations</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Consider the following card guessing game introduced by Diaconis and Graham (1981): there is a shuffled deck of $mn$ cards with n distinct cards appearing with multiplicity $m$. In each round, the player has to guess the top card of the deck, and is then told whether the guess was correct or not, the top card is then discarded and then the game continues with the next card. This is known as the partial feedback model. The aim is maximise the number of correct guesses. One possible strategy is the shifting strategy in which the player keeps guessing $1$ every round until the guess is correct in some round, and then keeps guessing $2$, and then $3$ and so on. We are interested in finding the expected score using this strategy.</p>

<p>We can restate this problem as finding the expected length of the longest increasing subsequence of the form $123\ldots i$ in a word formed using letters $1$ to $n$ where each letter occurs with multiplicity $m$. In this talk, we show that this number is $m+1 - 1/(m+2)$ plus an exponential error term. This settles a conjecture of Diaconis, Graham, He and Spiro.</p>

<p>This talk will be at an interface between combinatorics, probability and analysis, and is based on joint work with Alexander Clifton, Yifeng Huang, Sam Spiro and Semin Yoo.</p>

      <h2>Progress on the Kohayakawa-Kreuter conjecture</h2>
      <br>
      <p><p>Let \(H_1, ..., H_r\) be graphs. We write  \(G(n,p) \to (H_1, ..., H_r)\) to denote the property that whenever we colour the edges of \(G(n,p)\) with colours from the set \([r] := \{1, ..., r\}\) there exists some \(1 \leq i \leq r\) and a copy of \(H_i\) in \(G(n,p)\) monochromatic in colour \(i\).</p>

<p>There has been much interest in determining the asymptotic threshold function for this property. Rödl and Ruciński (1995) determined the threshold function for the general symmetric case; that is, when $H_1=\cdots =H_r$. A conjecture of Kohayakawa and Kreuter (1997), if true, would effectively resolve the asymmetric problem. Recently, the 1-statement of this conjecture was confirmed by Mousset, Nenadov and Samotij (2021+). The 0-statement however has only been proved for pairs of cycles, pairs of cliques and pairs of a clique and a cycle.</p>

<p>In this talk we introduce a reduction of the 0-statement of Kohayakawa and Kreuter’s conjecture to a certain deterministic, natural subproblem. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, we show this subproblem can be resolved for almost all pairs of regular graphs (satisfying properties one can assume when proving the 0-statement).</p>

      <br>
      <p><p>Several classical results in Ramsey theory (including famous theorems of Schur, van der Waerden, Rado) deal with finding monochromatic linear patterns in two-colourings of the integers. Our topic will be quantitative extensions of such results.</p>

<p>A linear system $L$ over $\mathcal{F}_q$ is common if the number of monochromatic solutions to $L=0$ in any two-colouring of $\mathcal{F}_q^n$ is asymptotically at least the expected number of monochromatic solutions in a random two-colouring of $\mathcal{F}_q^n$. Motivated by existing results for specific systems (such as Schur triples and arithmetic progressions), as well as extensive research on common and Sidorenko graphs, the systematic study of common systems of linear equations was recently initiated by Saad and Wolf. Fox, Pham and Zhao characterised common linear equations.</p>

<p>I will talk about recent progress towards a classification of common systems of two or more linear equations. In particular, the uncommonness of an arbitrarily large system $L$ can be reduced to studying single equations implied by $L$.</p>
