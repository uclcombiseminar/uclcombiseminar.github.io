<meta name="description" content="Given a graph $H$, we say that a graph $G$ is $H$-saturated if $G$ is maximally $H$-free, meaning $G$ contains no copy of $H$ but adding any new edge to $G$ creates a copy of $H$. The saturation problem is to determine the saturation number $\mathrm{sat}(n,H)$, the minimum number of edges in an $H$-saturated graph $G$ on $n$ vertices. The saturation number of cliques was determined exactly by Erdős, Hajnal and Moon in the 60s. The problem becomes more interesting, however, if we additionally require the minimum degree of $G$ to be large. Let $\mathrm{sat}(n,K_r,t)$ be the minimum number of edges in a $K_r$-saturated graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\delta(G) \geq t$. Day showed in 2017 that for fixed $r$ and $t$, $\mathrm{sat}(n,K_r,t)=tn-c(r,t)$ for large enough $n$, where $c(r,t)$ is a constant depending on $r$ and $t$. He raised the problem of estimating $c(r,t)$ and proved the estimates [2^t t^{3/2} \ll c(r,t) \leq t^{t^{2t^2}}] for fixed $r$ and large $t$. In this talk, I will present a result that shows that, for fixed $r$ and large $t$, the order of magnitude of $c(r,t)$ is $4^t t^{-1/2}$, and moreover gives information about the dependence on $r$. I will also discuss another result, which states that all the extremal graphs are blow-ups of some small graph. The problem of estimating $c(r,t)$ turns out to be intimately related to a celebrated result in extremal set theory known as the Two Families Theorem. There are several different versions of this theorem. I will discuss some of these and present a new version of the theorem which is needed in the proofs. This talk will be in Foster Court room 114." />

  <p>Given a graph $H$, we say that a graph $G$ is $H$-saturated if $G$ is maximally $H$-free, meaning $G$ contains no copy of $H$ but adding any new edge to $G$ creates a copy of $H$. The saturation problem is to determine the saturation number $\mathrm{sat}(n,H)$, the minimum number of edges in an $H$-saturated graph $G$ on $n$ vertices.  The saturation number of cliques was determined exactly by Erdős, Hajnal and Moon in the 60s. The problem becomes more interesting, however, if we additionally require the minimum degree of $G$ to be large.</p>

<p>Let $\mathrm{sat}(n,K_r,t)$ be the minimum number of edges in a $K_r$-saturated graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\delta(G) \geq t$. Day showed in 2017 that for fixed $r$ and $t$, $\mathrm{sat}(n,K_r,t)=tn-c(r,t)$ for large enough $n$, where $c(r,t)$ is a constant depending on $r$ and $t$. He raised the problem of estimating $c(r,t)$ and proved the estimates</p>

\[2^t t^{3/2} \ll c(r,t) \leq  t^{t^{2t^2}}\]

<p>for fixed $r$ and large $t$. In this talk, I will present a result that shows that, for fixed $r$ and large $t$, the order of magnitude of $c(r,t)$ is $4^t t^{-1/2}$, and moreover gives information about the dependence on $r$. I will also discuss another result, which states that all the extremal graphs are blow-ups of some small graph.</p>

<p>The problem of estimating $c(r,t)$ turns out to be intimately related to a celebrated result in extremal set theory known as the Two Families Theorem. There are several different versions of this theorem. I will discuss some of these and present a new version of the theorem which is needed in the proofs.</p>
