        <description>&lt;p&gt;Given a collection of hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}=(H_1, \ldots, H_m)$ with the same vertex set, an $m$-edge graph $F\subset \cup_{i\in [m]}H_i$ is a transversal if there is a bijection $\phi:E(F)\to [m]$ such that $e\in E(H_{\phi(e)})$ for each $e\in E(F)$. How large does the minimum degree of each $H_i$ need to be so that $\mathcal{H}$ necessarily contains a copy of $F$ that is a transversal? Each $H_i$ in the collection could be the same hypergraph, hence the minimum degree of each $H_i$ needs to be large enough to ensure that $F\subseteq H_i$. Since its general introduction by Joos and Kim, a growing body of work has shown that in many cases, this lower bound is tight. In this paper, we give a unified approach to this problem by giving a widely applicable sufficient condition for this lower bound to be asymptotically tight. This is general enough to recover many previous results in the area and obtain novel transversal variants of several classical Dirac-type results for (powers of) Hamiltn cycles. For example, we derive that any collection of $2n$ graphs on an $n$-vertex set, each with minimum degree at least $(2/3+o(1))n$, contains a transversal copy of the square of a Hamilton cycle. This can be viewed as a rainbow version of Pósa’s conjecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is joint work with Pranshu Gupta, Fabian Hamann, Olaf Parczyk, and Amedeo Sgueglia.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We will present a new upper bound of $s_r(K_k) = O(k^5 r^{5/2})$ on the Ramsey parameter $s_r(K_k)$ introduced by Burr, Erd&lt;span&gt;ő&lt;/span&gt;s and Lovász in 1976, which is defined as the smallest minimum degree of a graph $G$ such that any $r$-colouring of the edges of $G$ contains a monochromatic $K_k$, whereas no proper subgraph of $G$ has this property. This improves the previous upper bound of $s_r(K_k) = O(k^6 r^3)$ proved by Fox et al. The construction used in our proof relies on a group theoretic model of generalised quadrangles introduced by Kantor in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is joint work with John Bamberg and Thomas Lesgourgues.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Independent sets in bipartite regular graphs have been studied extensively in combinatorics, probability, computer science and more. The problem of counting independent sets is particularly interesting in the $d$-dimensional hypercube {$0,1$}$^d$, motivated by the lattice gas hardcore model from statistical physics. Independent sets also turn out to be very interesting in the context of random graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of independent sets in the hypercube {$0,1$}$^d$ was estimated precisely by Korshunov and Sapozhenko in the 1980s and recently refined by Jenssen and Perkins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk we will discuss new results on the number of independent sets in a random subgraph of the hypercube. The results extend to the hardcore model and rely on an analysis of the antiferromagnetic Ising model on the hypercube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk is based on joint work with Yinon Spinka.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For $0 \le r &amp;lt; k$, a Hamiltonian $r$-cycle in a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ is a cyclic ordering of the vertices of $H$ in which the edges are segments of length $k$ and every two consecutive edges overlap in exactly $r$ vertices.
We show that for all $0 \le r &amp;lt; k-1$, every Dirac $k$-graph, that is, a $k$-graph with minimum co-degree $pn$ for some $p&amp;gt;1/2$, has (up to a subexponential factor) at least as many Hamiltonian $r$-cycles as a typical random $k$-graph with edge-probability p.
This improves a recent result of Glock, Gould, Joos, Osthus and Kühn, and verifies a conjecture of Ferber, Krivelevich and Sudakov for all values $0 \le r &amp;lt; k-1$.
(Joint work with Asaf Ferber and Liam Hardiman.)&lt;/p&gt;
