        <description>&lt;p&gt;Given a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ and an $r$-colouring of its edges, 
we look for a minimum $l$-degree condition that guarantees the existence 
of a perfect matching in $H$ that has significantly more than $n/rk$ edges in one colour. 
We refer to it as a colour-bias perfect matching.
For $2$-coloured graphs, a result of Balogh, Csaba, Jing and Pluhár yields the 
minimum degree threshold that ensures a perfect matching of significant colour-bias. 
In this talk, I will present an analogous of this result for $k$-uniform hypergraphs. 
More precisely, for each $2 \le l &amp;lt; k$ and $r \ge 2$ we determined the minimum $l$-degree 
threshold for forcing a perfect matching of significant colour-bias in an $r$-coloured $k$-uniform hypergraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is joint work with József Balogh and Andrew Treglown.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Brown-Erdős-Sós initiated the study of the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $r$-graph 
such that no $k$ edges span at most $s$ vertices. 
If $s=rk−2k+2$ then this function is quadratic in $n$ and its asymptotic was previously known for 
$k=2,3,4$. We determine the values of the limit in the Brown-Erdős-Sós problem for $k=5,6,7$ and generalise them to all uniformity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is joint work with Stefan Glock, Jaehoon Kim, Lyuben Lichev and Oleg Pikhurko.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let $n, t, k$ be positive integers and say that a family $\mathcal{P}$ of permutations is $(k,t)$-shattering for $[n]=\set{1,\dotsc, n}$ if it induces at least $t$ distinct orders on each $k$-subset of $[n]$.
In 1971, Spencer constructed $(k,k)$-shattering families of size $O(\log \log n)$ and showed that $(k,k!)$-shattering families have size $\Omega(\log n)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Füredi then asked in 1996 whether minimal $(k,t)$-shattering families always have sizes in one of three regimes: $O(1)$, $\Theta(\log \log n)$, $\Theta(\log n)$.
In 2023, Johnson and Wickes settled the case $k=3$ affirmatively and asked whether this could be extended to general $k$.
In recent joint work with António Girão and Lukas Michel show the existence of a jump between the $\Theta(\log \log n)$ regime and a new $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$ regime when $k\geq 4$, thereby answering both the general question of Füredi and the question of Johnson and Wickes negatively.
Moreover, we settle the case $k=4$ and greatly narrow the range of $t$ for which asymptotic sizes of such families are unknown.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Liouville function $\lambda(n)$ is defined to be +1 if n is a product of an even number of primes, and -1 otherwise. In many ways, the Liouville function is expected to behave like a random sequence of +1’s and -1’s. Instances of this phenomenon are intimately connected with the distribution of primes. For instance, the statement that the partial sums of the Liouville function grow no faster than $x^{1/2+\epsilon}$ is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis. The two-point Chowla conjecture predicts that the average of $\lambda(n)\lambda(n+1)$ over $n\leq x$ tends to zero as $x\to \infty$. I will present my work on a logarithmically weighted version of this problem. The proof uses elementary combinatorics to study a graph encoding number-theoretic information.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We show that any $d$-regular graph can be approximately decomposed into paths of length almost $d$, giving an approximate solution to a problem of Kotzig from 1957. Along the way, we also show that almost all vertices of a $d$-regular graph can be partitioned into $n/(d+1)$ paths, asymptotically confirming a conjecture of Magnant and Martin from 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is joint work with Richard Montgomery, Alexey Pokrovskiy, and Benny Sudakov.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the first results in extremal graph theory is Turán’s
theorem, which states that the Turán graph $T(n,r)$ 
maximizes the number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that 
does not contain $K_{r+1}$ as a subgraph. More generally, 
given two graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Turán number 
$ex(n, H, F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in an 
$n$-vertex $F$-free graph and such graphs with $ex(n, H, F)$ 
copies of $H$ are called extremal graphs. 
For fixed $H$, $F=K_{r+1}$ and $r$ large enough, 
we recently showed in a joint work with Morrison, Nir, Norine, 
and Rzążewski, that the extremal graph for the 
generalized Turán problem is the Turán graph  $T(n,r)$. 
This talk discusses this result and more broadly, 
results on generalized Turán numbers.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;An $n$-vertex graph $G$ is a $C$-expander if 
$|N(X)|\geq C|X|$ for every $X \subseteq V(G)$ 
with $|X|&amp;lt; n/2C$ and there is an edge between 
every two disjoint sets of at least $n/2C$ vertices.
We show that there is some constant $C&amp;gt;0$ 
for which every $C$-expander is Hamiltonian. 
In particular, this implies the well known 
conjecture of Krivelevich and Sudakov from 2003 
on Hamilton cycles in $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs. 
This completes a long line of research on the 
Hamiltonicity of sparse graphs, and has many applications.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A regular $k$-partite tournament is a regular orientation 
of the balanced complete $k$-partite graph. Kühn and Osthus proved 
that for all $k \ge 4$ any large enough regular $k$-partite tournament 
can be decomposed into edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles and conjectured 
the same to be true for all $k$. 
Granet proved the conjecture for $k=2$ and, somewhat surprisingly, 
gave a construction of a non-Hamilton decomposable regular tripartite tournament. 
Our main result is a proof that an approximate version of the conjecture still holds
for $k=3$, i.e. that in each such large tournament one may find edge-disjoint 
Hamilton cycles covering all but $o(n^2)$ edges. We also prove that if $a &amp;gt; 1/3$,
any balanced regular tripartite digraph with minimum semidegree at least $a*n$ is Hamilton decomposable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is based on joint work with J. Lada, V. Patel, Y. Pehova, J. Skokan.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;The question under which minimum degree conditions a given 
hypergraph contains a Hamilton cycle has received a lot of attention 
over the past twenty years. In this talk, I will give an overview of the 
progress in the area and then present some new results.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We prove that the family of largest cuts in the binomial random graph 
exhibits the following stability property: with high probability, 
there is a set of $(1-o(1))n$ vertices that is partitioned in the 
same manner by all maximum cuts. We also show some applications of this property - in particular, to the validity of Simonovits’s property in binomial random graphs. 
Recall that a graph is $H$-Simonovits, if each of its largest $H$-free subgraphs is $(\chi(H)−1)$-partite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk is based on joint work with Ilay Hoshen and Wojciech Samotij
