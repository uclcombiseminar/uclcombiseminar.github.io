        <description>&lt;p&gt;Classical theorems of Dirac and of Ghouila-Houri establish the minimum degree theshold that guarantees the existence of a Hamilton cycle in a graph and in a directed graph respectively. (For oriented graphs, the degree threshold was established much more recently.) By imposing suitable regularity and/or connectivity conditions on graphs, one can lower the degree threshold at which a Hamilton cycle is guaranteed to appear, and this is quite well understood in the case of graphs. Conjectures of Kuhn and Osthus and of Jackson describe the corresponding situation for directed graphs and oriented graphs respectively. I will discuss approximate solutions to these conjectures. This is based on joint work with Allan Lo and Mehmet Akif Yildiz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will be in Gordon Square (26) Room B32.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Given a small graph $F$, what is the maximum number of induced copies of $F$ that an $n$-vertex graph can contain, and what does a graph with many copies look like? This is the inducibility problem introduced by Pippenger and Golumbic in 1975, which is still wide open for most $F$. I will give a survey of the area and will mention some of the latest results, including joint work with Hong Liu, Oleg Pikhurko and Maryam Sharifzadeh.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let us call a graph/hypergraph $G$ extremal if there exists a finite family $F$ such that $G$ is an $F$-free graph with the maximum number of edges. The classical Erdős–Stone-Simonovitsz theorem implies that Turan graphs approximate all extremal graphs in edit distance. This talk is an invitation to its analogue in the hypergraph setting: what hypergraphs can approximate all extremal hypergraphs? I’ll mention some related results.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk I will discuss some recent work examining the extremal relationship between two well-studied graph parameters: the order of the largest homogeneous set in a graph $G$ and the maximal number of distinct degrees appearing in an induced subgraph of $G$, denoted respectively by $\mathrm{hom}(G)$ and $f(G)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main theorem improves estimates due to Bukh and Sudakov and to Narayanan and Tomon and shows that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with $\mathrm{hom} (G)$ at least $n^{1/2}$ then $f(G) &amp;gt; ( n / \mathrm{hom} (G) )^{1 - o(1)}$. The bound here is sharp up to the $o(1)$-term, and asymptotically solves a conjecture of Narayanan and Tomon. In particular, this implies that $\max ( \mathrm{hom} (G), f(G) ) &amp;gt; n^{1/2 -o(1)}$ for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, which is also sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship between these parameters is known to change when $\mathrm{hom}(G) &amp;lt; n^{1/2}$. I hope to discuss the suspected relationship in this other region, along with supporting results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joint work with Laurențiu Ploscaru.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk will be in Foster Court Room 243.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;regular bipartite tournament&lt;/em&gt; is an orientation of a complete
balanced bipartite graph $K_{2n,2n}$ where every vertex has its in- and
outdegree both equal to $n$. In 1981, Jackson conjectured that any
regular bipartite tournament can be decomposed into Hamilton cycles. We
prove this conjecture for sufficiently large $n$. Along the way, we also
prove several further results, including a conjecture of Liebenau and
Pehova on Hamilton decompositions of dense bipartite digraphs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A factorisation $x = u_1u_2\ldots$ of an infinite word $x$ on alphabet $X$ is called ‘super-monochromatic’, for a given colouring of the finite
words $X^∗$ on alphabet $X$, if each word $u_{k_1} u_{k_2} \ldots u_{k_n}$, where $k_1 &amp;lt; · · · &amp;lt; k_n$,
is the same colour. A direct application of Hindman’s theorem shows that
if $x$ is eventually periodic, then for every finite colouring of $X^∗$, there exist a suffix of $x$ that admits a super-monochromatic factorisation. What
about the converse?
In this talk we show that the converse does indeed hold: thus a word $x$ is eventually periodic if and only if for every finite colouring of $X^∗$
there is a suffix of $x$ having a super-monochromatic factorisation. This
has been a conjecture in the community for some time. Our main tool
is a Ramsey result about alternating sums. This provides a strong link
between Ramsey theory and the combinatorics of infinite words.&lt;/p&gt;
