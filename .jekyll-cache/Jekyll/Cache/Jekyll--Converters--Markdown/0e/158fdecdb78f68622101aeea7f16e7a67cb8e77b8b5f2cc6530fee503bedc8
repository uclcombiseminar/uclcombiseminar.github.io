I"Ä<p>Garbe, HladkÃ½, Å ileikis and Skerman recently introduced a
class of discrete-time random graph processes called flip processes. A
flip process starts with a given $n$-vertex graph, and each step of a flip
process involves randomly selecting a $k$-tuple of distinct vertices and
modifying the induced subgraph according to a predetermined rule. It was
proved by Garbe, HladkÃ½, Å ileikis and Skerman that the typical behaviour
of flip processes correspond to certain continuous-time deterministic
graphon trajectories. In this talk I will discuss recent work towards
characterising flip process rules with the same trajectories.</p>
