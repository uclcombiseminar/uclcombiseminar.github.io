I"÷<p>A factorisation $x = u_1u_2\ldots$ of an infinite word $x$ on alphabet $X$ is called â€˜super-monochromaticâ€™, for a given colouring of the finite
words $X^âˆ—$ on alphabet $X$, if each word $u_{k_1} u_{k_2} \ldots u_{k_n}$, where $k_1 &lt; Â· Â· Â· &lt; k_n$,
is the same colour. A direct application of Hindmanâ€™s theorem shows that
if $x$ is eventually periodic, then for every finite colouring of $X^âˆ—$, there exist a suffix of $x$ that admits a super-monochromatic factorisation. What
about the converse?
In this talk we show that the converse does indeed hold: thus a word $x$ is eventually periodic if and only if for every finite colouring of $X^âˆ—$
there is a suffix of $x$ having a super-monochromatic factorisation. This
has been a conjecture in the community for some time. Our main tool
is a Ramsey result about alternating sums. This provides a strong link
between Ramsey theory and the combinatorics of infinite words.</p>
