I"ô<p>In 1985, Erd≈ës, Faudree, Rousseau, and Schelp showed that for every graph $H$ with chromatic number $k$ and every bounded degree tree $T$ of size $\Omega(|H|^4)$, the Ramsey number $R(T,H)$ is $(k-1)(|T|-1)+\sigma(H)$, where $\sigma(H)$ is the size of the smallest colour class across all proper $k$-colourings of $H$.  In this talk, I will present a quantitative improvement on this result, showing that $R(T,H)=(k-1)(|T|-1)+\sigma(H)$ for every tree $T$ of size $\Omega(|H|)$ and bounded maximum degree. This result is tight and confirms a conjecture of Balla, Pokrovskiy, and Sudakov.
This is joint work with Richard Montgomery and Jun Yan.</p>
