I"Ì<p>Let us call a graph/hypergraph $G$ extremal if there exists a finite family $F$ such that $G$ is an $F$-free graph with the maximum number of edges. The classical ErdÅ‘sâ€“Stone-Simonovitsz theorem implies that Turan graphs approximate all extremal graphs in edit distance. This talk is an invitation to its analogue in the hypergraph setting: what hypergraphs can approximate all extremal hypergraphs? Iâ€™ll mention some related results.</p>
