I"|<p>Scott and Seymour conjectured the existence of a function $f$ such that, for every graph $G$ and tournament $T$ on the same vertex set, $\chi(G)\geq f(k)$ implies that $\chi(G[N_T^+(v)])\geq k$ for some vertex $v$. We will disprove this conjecture even if $v$ is replaced by a vertex set of size $\mathcal{O}(\log{|V(G)|})$. 
As a consequence, we obtain a negative answer to a question of Harutyunyan, Le, Thomassé, and Wu concerning the analogous statement where the graph $G$ is replaced by another tournament. Time permitting, we will also discuss the setting in which chromatic number is replaced by degeneracy, where a quite different behaviour is exhibited.</p>

<p>This is joint work with António Girão, Kevin Hendrey, Freddie Illingworth, Florian Lehner, Lukas Michel, and Raphael Steiner.</p>

<p>This talk will be in Bedford Way (20) room 639.</p>
