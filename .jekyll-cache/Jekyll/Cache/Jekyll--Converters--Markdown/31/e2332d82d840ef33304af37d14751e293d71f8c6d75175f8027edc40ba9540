I"¸<p>A subset $A$ of a group is said to be product free if for all elements $a,b$ in $A$ their product $ab$ is not in $A$. In 1985 Babai and SÃ³s posed the problem of determining the largest product free sets in the alternating group. We solve this problem completely when $n$ is sufficiently large.</p>

<p>Our proof combines representation theory with a recent machinery we developed called `hypercontractvity for global functionsâ€™.</p>
