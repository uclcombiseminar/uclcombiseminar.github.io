I"<p>The Liouville function $\lambda(n)$ is defined to be +1 if n is a product of an even number of primes, and -1 otherwise. In many ways, the Liouville function is expected to behave like a random sequence of +1’s and -1’s. Instances of this phenomenon are intimately connected with the distribution of primes. For instance, the statement that the partial sums of the Liouville function grow no faster than $x^{1/2+\epsilon}$ is equivalent to the Riemann Hypothesis. The two-point Chowla conjecture predicts that the average of $\lambda(n)\lambda(n+1)$ over $n\leq x$ tends to zero as $x\to \infty$. I will present my work on a logarithmically weighted version of this problem. The proof uses elementary combinatorics to study a graph encoding number-theoretic information.
