I"Ç<p>Given a small graph $F$, what is the maximum number of induced copies of $F$ that an $n$-vertex graph can contain, and what does a graph with many copies look like? This is the inducibility problem introduced by Pippenger and Golumbic in 1975, which is still wide open for most $F$. I will give a survey of the area and will mention some of the latest results, including joint work with Hong Liu, Oleg Pikhurko and Maryam Sharifzadeh.</p>
