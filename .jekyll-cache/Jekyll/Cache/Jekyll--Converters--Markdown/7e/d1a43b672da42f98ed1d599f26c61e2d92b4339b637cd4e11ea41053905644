I"é<p>We discuss a technique for obtaining new Ramsey theorems from the compositions of old ones. As our simplest application, we show that any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ contains arbitrarily large $A,B\subset \mathbb{N}$ with $(A+B)\cup (A\cdot B)$ monochromatic, addressing a problem of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson. More generally, we also prove iterated versions of this, finding monochromatic sets such as ${A \circ_1 (B \circ_2 C): \circ_i\in {+,\cdot}} $ and a variety of mixed arithmetic and geometric versions of van der Waerdenâ€™s theorem, finding monochromatic sets such as ${a+id, c\cdot ad^i: i\leq k}$ and ${a(b+ic)^j: i,j\leq k}.$</p>
