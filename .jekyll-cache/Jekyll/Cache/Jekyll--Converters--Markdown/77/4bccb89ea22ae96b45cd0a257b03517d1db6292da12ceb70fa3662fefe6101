I"Ã<p>We show that any $d$-regular graph can be approximately decomposed into paths of length almost $d$, giving an approximate solution to a problem of Kotzig from 1957. Along the way, we also show that almost all vertices of a $d$-regular graph can be partitioned into $n/(d+1)$ paths, asymptotically confirming a conjecture of Magnant and Martin from 2009.</p>

<p>This is joint work with Richard Montgomery, Alexey Pokrovskiy, and Benny Sudakov.</p>
