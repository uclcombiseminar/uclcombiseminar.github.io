I"V<p>In this talk I will discuss some recent work examining the extremal relationship between two well-studied graph parameters: the order of the largest homogeneous set in a graph $G$ and the maximal number of distinct degrees appearing in an induced subgraph of $G$, denoted respectively by $\mathrm{hom}(G)$ and $f(G)$.</p>

<p>Our main theorem improves estimates due to Bukh and Sudakov and to Narayanan and Tomon and shows that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with $\mathrm{hom} (G)$ at least $n^{1/2}$ then $f(G) &gt; ( n / \mathrm{hom} (G) )^{1 - o(1)}$. The bound here is sharp up to the $o(1)$-term, and asymptotically solves a conjecture of Narayanan and Tomon. In particular, this implies that $\max ( \mathrm{hom} (G), f(G) ) &gt; n^{1/2 -o(1)}$ for any $n$-vertex graph $G$, which is also sharp.</p>

<p>The relationship between these parameters is known to change when $\mathrm{hom}(G) &lt; n^{1/2}$. I hope to discuss the suspected relationship in this other region, along with supporting results.</p>

<p>Joint work with Laurențiu Ploscaru.</p>

<p>This talk will be in Foster Court Room 243.</p>
