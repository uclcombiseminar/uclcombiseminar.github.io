      <h2>21st October 2024 - <a href="">Leo Versteegen</a> (London School of Economics)</h2>
      <h2>Packing paths in sparse graphs</h2>
      <br />
      <p><p>This talk is based on joint work with Ir≈°iƒç and Portier about the maximal number of vertices that can be covered by disjoint long paths in $G(n,p)$ in the supercritical regime $p=(1+\epsilon)/n$. As a key ingredient we determine the number of disjoint paths of a given length that can be packed into a random labelled tree. We will also discuss a related algorithmic problem about revealing paths in hidden random graph by querying as few edges as possible.</p>
