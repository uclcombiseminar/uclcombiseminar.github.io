I"‚<p>Brown-Erd≈ës-S√≥s initiated the study of the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $r$-graph 
such that no $k$ edges span at most $s$ vertices. 
If $s=rk‚àí2k+2$ then this function is quadratic in $n$ and its asymptotic was previously known for 
$k=2,3,4$. We determine the values of the limit in the Brown-Erd≈ës-S√≥s problem for $k=5,6,7$ and generalise them to all uniformity.</p>
