I"<p>A Latin square of order $n$ is an $n$ by $n$ grid filled with $n$ symbols, so
that every symbol appears exactly once in each row and each column. A
transversal of a Latin square is a collection of cells in the grid which
share no row, column or symbol.</p>

<p>The Ryser-Brualdi-Stein conjecture says that every Latin square of order
$n$ has a transversal with $n-1$ cells if $n$ is even and with $n$ cells if $n$ is
odd. Recently, Keevash, Pokrovskiy, Sudakov and Yepremyan broke a
long-standing bound on this problem by showing that every Latin square
of order $n$ has a transversal with $n-O(\log n/\log \log n)$ cells.</p>

<p>I will discuss how to make further progress on this problem, and in
particular the challenges of using absorption techniques in this setting.</p>
