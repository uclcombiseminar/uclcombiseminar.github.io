      <h2>14th October 2024 - <a href="https://czarategueren.github.io/">Kada Williams</a> (University of Cambridge)</h2>
      <h2>Ball Poset Width</h2>
      <br />
      <p><p>Given a $k$-uniform hypergraph $H$ and an $r$-colouring of its edges,
we look for a minimum $l$-degree condition that guarantees the existence
of a perfect matching in $H$ that has significantly more than $n/rk$ edges in one colour.
We refer to it as a colour-bias perfect matching.
For $2$-coloured graphs, a result of Balogh, Csaba, Jing and Pluhár yields the
minimum degree threshold that ensures a perfect matching of significant colour-bias.
In this talk, I will present an analogous of this result for $k$-uniform hypergraphs.
More precisely, for each $2 \le l &lt; k$ and $r \ge 2$ we determined the minimum $l$-degree
threshold for forcing a perfect matching of significant colour-bias in an $r$-coloured $k$-uniform hypergraph.</p>

<p>This is joint work with József Balogh and Andrew Treglown.</p>
