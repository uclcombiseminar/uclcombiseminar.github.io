I"à<p>It is fairly easy to prove that every finite poset can be viewed as a subposet of $(2^{[N]},\subseteq)$ for sufficiently large $N$. The width of such a subposet is the size of its largest empty subposet. Clearly, sets of equal size in $2^{[N]}$ are incomparable, thus forming an empty subposet. In other words, layers are antichains. We demonstrate how a certain symmetry of the subposet is conducive to showing that its maximal antichain is the largest layer.
