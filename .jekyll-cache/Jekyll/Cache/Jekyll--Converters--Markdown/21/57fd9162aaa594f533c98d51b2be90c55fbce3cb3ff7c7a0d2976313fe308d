I"ﬁ<p>In 2001, Koml√≥s, S√°rk√∂zy and Szemer√©di proved that for sufficiently large $n$, every $n$-vertex graph with minimum degree at least $n/2 + o(n)$ contains a copy of every $n$-vertex tree with maximum degree at most $O(n/\log n)$. We prove the corresponding result for directed graphs. That is, we show that for sufficiently large $n$, every $n$-vertex directed graph with minimum semidegree at least $n/2 + o(n)$ contains a copy of every $n$-vertex oriented tree whose underlying maximum degree is at most $O(n/\log n)$. This improves a recent result of Mycroft and Naia, which requires the oriented trees to have underlying maximum degree at most $\Delta$, for any constant $\Delta$ and sufficiently large $n$.</p>
