I"<p>One of the first results in extremal graph theory is Turán’s
theorem, which states that the Turán graph $T(n,r)$ 
maximizes the number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that 
does not contain $K_{r+1}$ as a subgraph. More generally, 
given two graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized Turán number 
$ex(n, H, F)$ is the largest number of copies of $H$ in an 
$n$-vertex $F$-free graph and such graphs with $ex(n, H, F)$ 
copies of $H$ are called extremal graphs. 
For fixed $H$, $F=K_{r+1}$ and $r$ large enough, 
we recently showed in a joint work with Morrison, Nir, Norine, 
and Rzążewski, that the extremal graph for the 
generalized Turán problem is the Turán graph  $T(n,r)$. 
This talk discusses this result and more broadly, 
results on generalized Turán numbers.</p>
