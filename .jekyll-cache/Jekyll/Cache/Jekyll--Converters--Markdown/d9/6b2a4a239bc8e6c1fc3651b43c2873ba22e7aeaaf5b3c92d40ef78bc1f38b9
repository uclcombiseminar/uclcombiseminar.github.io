I" <p>A $k$-uniform hypergraph $H = (V, E)$ is $k$-partite if $V$ can be partitioned into $k$ sets $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ such that each edge in $E$ contains precisely one vertex from each $V_i$. For example, a 2-partite 2-uniform hypergraph is a bipartite graph. In this talk, we will discuss extensions of results on bipartite graphs to this more general setting pf hypergraphs. Specifically, we will consider list colorings, balanced colorings, and balanced independent sets.</p>
