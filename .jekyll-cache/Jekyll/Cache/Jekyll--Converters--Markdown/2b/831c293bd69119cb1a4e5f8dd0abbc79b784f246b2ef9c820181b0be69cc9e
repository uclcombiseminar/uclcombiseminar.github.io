I"É<p>An $n$-vertex graph $G$ is a $C$-expander if 
$|N(X)|\geq C|X|$ for every $X \subseteq V(G)$ 
with $|X|&lt; n/2C$ and there is an edge between 
every two disjoint sets of at least $n/2C$ vertices.
We show that there is some constant $C&gt;0$ 
for which every $C$-expander is Hamiltonian. 
In particular, this implies the well known 
conjecture of Krivelevich and Sudakov from 2003 
on Hamilton cycles in $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs. 
This completes a long line of research on the 
Hamiltonicity of sparse graphs, and has many applications.</p>
