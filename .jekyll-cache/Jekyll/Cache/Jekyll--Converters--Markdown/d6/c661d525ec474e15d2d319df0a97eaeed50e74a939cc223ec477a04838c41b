      <h2>Linear configurations containing 4-term arithmetic progressions are uncommon</h2>
      <br />
      <p><p>A linear configuration is called common (in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$) if every 2-coloring of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ yields at least the number of monochromatic instances of a randomly chosen coloring. Saad and Wolf asked whether, analogously to a result by Thomason in graph theory, every configuration containing a 4-term arithmetic progression is uncommon. I will sketch a proof confirming that this is the case and discuss some of the difficulties in finding a full characterisation of common configurations.</p>
